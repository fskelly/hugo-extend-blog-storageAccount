<p>There is great documentation, obviously, on <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh305220.aspx">TECHNET</a>. I have however found out a few other things which will helpfully make your transition a little easier. I have found that the following can cause some complications and how to “mitigate” these if you will.</p>
<p>Service Manager 2010</p>
<p>Connectors – Please make sure that your connectors are NOT running while you do the upgrade, the upgrade will work, however your connectors will run and attempt to catch up with itself. This will in turn, create additional load on the SQL Service on your Management Server, which will in turn affect overall performance and will slow down workflows in particular.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fix : Simply ensure that your connectors are NOT running.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cubes – If you are upgrading from a PRE-RTM Version to RTM, please note that I am sure that is not supported by Microsoft unless you were a TAP customer. So, this would be more for a lab environment. If your cubes are running, please allow them to process and ensure that they are in a processed and preferably NOT a “Partial Processed” state. Please also check the status of these job as per the <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh305220.aspx">TECHNET</a> article and ensure that get-scdwjob returns all jobs in a “Not Started” state.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fix : Ensure all cubes are in a processed state and NOT “Running” or “Partial Processed”<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for System Centre Service Manager 2012, the connectors are greatly improved in SCSM 2012, while your SCSM 2010 Connectors will work, you will see that there is a difference in the Connectors as seen below.</p>
<p><a href="http://fskelly.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/blog21.jpg"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>The old connectors “Active Directory” are migrated from SCSM 2010 to SCSM 2012. However, the new type “ADConnector” are more robust and more streamlined. I would recommend Creating the new type for all your existing connectors, disabling the existing and running only the new connectors. Once you are happy with the results and that new objects are being created and tested this for some time, then remove the older connectors.</p>
<p>If I can think of anything more, I will post this in future.</p>

                So, for the Management Server.
This was very easy and quite painless for me.
 Backup Encryption Key (for Disaster Recovery Purposes) Install Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 (This is a pre-requisite for SCSM 2012) Remove Operations Manager Agent if this is installed, as the installer WILL stop you from continuing if the OpsMan Agent is installed. Run the Upgrade, PLEASE NOTE that if the Portal is installed on your Management Server, it will be REMOVED during the upgrade.

                So, my journey with System Centre Service Manager 2012 Beta has begun and so far I have indeed found some funnies.
I will be blogging about them, to make everyone else’s life a little bit easier and in the hope of better product adoption for this product. It is simply put a fantastic product.
Ok, so the first time I ran the upgrade (remember I have a pre-prod environment), so I was able to rollback and did not have to follow Disaster Recovery with the Failure.

                So now, I move onto the final part of the SCSM 2012 journey, the Portal.
The install was pretty straight-forward, the most difficult part is deciding how you would split your roles or if you are going to split your roles, here is the guide for role placement.
So, once you have decided which route you would like to follow, here are the steps I followed.
 Start the setup.
