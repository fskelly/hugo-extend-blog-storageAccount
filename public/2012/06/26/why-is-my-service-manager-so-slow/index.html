From SCSM 2010 to SCSM SP1 and most of the CU’s before I upgraded to SCSM 2012 Beta and RC and then to RTM (with the help of a Microsoft TAP Program). Service Manager is now quite entrenched in our business and has been running quite well for a very long time. However, a little while ago we began to experience performance issues with the Console and the logging of calls and the application of Workflows. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Time for some investigation. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->There was a general slowdown with everything and business was not happy with this. So let the troubleshooting begin. Since there is a SQL back-end, I decided that this was a good place to start. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I was running a sp_who2 on my SQL server and I was seeing a lot of “blocking” happening. There will some “blocking” for a very short while, while the ServiceManager database is updated. However, I was seeing “blocking” SPID’s consuming processor time for several minutes and this is NOT normal at all. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As a result of this, my workflows were not kicking off properly and a few other issues including the slow pickup of e-mailed in incidents from SMTP “Drop Folder” and extremely slow response when assigning incidents to new people/tiers to name but a few. In general, Service Manager was SLOW!!!! <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->After much troubleshooting and some help from MS. It was determined to be a corrupt workflow, what had actually happened to me, is that my MP containing my Workflow was corrupted. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, I stopped the “Health Service”, disabled all the workflows and slowly started re-enabling workflows and then starting the “Health Service” again and slowly started testing like that and I was able to determine that any workflow or template within a set MP was causing the SQL Blocking. As a result, I re-created the workflows and Templates from scratch and now I have no issues at all. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Slow and painful, but well worth it now.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Follow me.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

                So, just last night, we had an issue with our cluster.One of our disks would not come online. We were seeing an error event ID: 1304 as below.
So, we began to investigate as all the Technet articles state that the drive is corrupted and Disk Signatures need to be changed, however we have had no major changes in the last little while. We were also able to view to CSV Volume from our SAN management tools.

                So, You are now ready to take the plunge and upgrade to SCSM 2012 RTM as it now “publically” available.
There is great documentation, obviously, on TECHNET. I have however found out a few other things which will helpfully make your transition a little easier. I have found that the following can cause some complications and how to “mitigate” these if you will.
Service Manager 2010
Connectors – Please make sure that your connectors are NOT running while you do the upgrade, the upgrade will work, however your connectors will run and attempt to catch up with itself.

                So now, I move onto the final part of the SCSM 2012 journey, the Portal.
The install was pretty straight-forward, the most difficult part is deciding how you would split your roles or if you are going to split your roles, here is the guide for role placement.
So, once you have decided which route you would like to follow, here are the steps I followed.
 Start the setup.
