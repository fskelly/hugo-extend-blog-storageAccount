      <description>So, recently I decided to take the plunge and upgrade to SCOM 2012. So, there were a few pre-requisites that I needed as per the prereq checker that is built into OpsMan 2012.The “big ones” were as follows. 1. OpsMan 2007 R2 CU52. And FTS (Full Text Search) for SQL. So, these seem easy enough to fix. 1. Simple downloadCumulative Update 5 for System Center Operations Manager 2007 R2and install. To be honest, I found this articlesuper helpful for the installation of this Cumulative Update, nice and easy to follow.</description>
