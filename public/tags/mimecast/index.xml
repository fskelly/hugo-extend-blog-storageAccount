      <description>I decided to yet again sue Bitlocker, even knowing the previous experencies i have with it. It previously cost me all my data, however i had backed up all my data. I am sure by now you know where this is going. So, the weekend just past i decided to Encrypt my Hard Drive using BitLocker. I am not sure what i did to piss off Murphy, but as usual with me and BitLocker something went wrong.</description>
