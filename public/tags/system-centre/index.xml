      <description>Just recently in a test environment, a script or some such other gremlin caused some absolute havoc on my system. Before you ask, I had NO Backup in place of this system. This system was System Center Orchestrator. However, once a week, I do a “sort-of” backup. By this, I mean I export all my Runbooks and place a copy on my local machine and a file server and the SCORCH (System Center ORCHestrator) server.</description>

      <title>Auto-Closing work items made easy–Service Manager 2012</title>

      <description>So, there are a few ways of tackling the issue of automatically closing Incidents/Change Requests within Service Manager. Most of these solutions rely on a script leveraging SMLets. So you would create a script and then create a workflow and end up importing the Management Pack into Service Manager. The issue with this is the following, it is quite time consuming and should change under the hood with Service Manager, like the changes from 2010 to 2012, your script will most likely stop working.</description>

      <title>Installing System Centre Orchestrator</title>

      <description>So, just recently I decided to install System Centre Orchestrator. It appears easy enough if you follow the Technet articles. This addresses the need for Service Accounts and the permissions needed by these accounts and there functions. It also helps you to size and decide the Orchestrator installation type that would best suit your environment. It helps you to decide the best way to break the components if you want to.</description>

      <title>System Centre Service Manager 2012 Portal</title>
      <link>https://cloudadventures.fskelly.com/2011/11/30/system-centre-service-manager-2012-portal/</link>

      <guid>https://cloudadventures.fskelly.com/2011/11/30/system-centre-service-manager-2012-portal/</guid>
      <description>So now, I move onto the final part of the SCSM 2012 journey, the Portal.
The install was pretty straight-forward, the most difficult part is deciding how you would split your roles or if you are going to split your roles, here is the guide for role placement.
So, once you have decided which route you would like to follow, here are the steps I followed.
 Start the setup.</description>

      <title>Service Manager 2012 Management Server (Upgrade)</title>
      <link>https://cloudadventures.fskelly.com/2011/11/24/service-manager-2012-management-server-upgrade/</link>

      <guid>https://cloudadventures.fskelly.com/2011/11/24/service-manager-2012-management-server-upgrade/</guid>
      <description>So, for the Management Server.
This was very easy and quite painless for me.
 Backup Encryption Key (for Disaster Recovery Purposes) Install Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 (This is a pre-requisite for SCSM 2012) Remove Operations Manager Agent if this is installed, as the installer WILL stop you from continuing if the OpsMan Agent is installed. Run the Upgrade, PLEASE NOTE that if the Portal is installed on your Management Server, it will be REMOVED during the upgrade.</description>

      <description>Hi All,
I know it has been a little while.
The reports built into Service Manager are great, however when you try to get a bit creative and automate some of the reports, you are going to run into some issues. So to work around theses issues, I did the following.
Create a custom report from SQL Reporting Services and modified for my needs, I was focusing more on “Incident Analyst” and I was looking for a breakdown of the number of Incidents per Analysts in a week period.</description>

      <title>DPM and Invoke-Command, bring the DPM shell to your machine</title>

      <guid>https://cloudadventures.fskelly.com/2011/06/15/dpm-and-invoke-command-bring-the-dpm-shell-to-your-machine/</guid>
      <description>Not that long ago, I created an article about DPM and I referenced DPM commands to be run in the DPM shell and only now realised that not everyone has the DPM console installed as this is not the easiest console to install and get working.
So, I am now the Proud Owner of Learn Windows PowerShell in a month of Lunches and I am an now playing and have figured out how to import the necessary commands with Remoting.</description>

      <description>Have you ever been in a situation where you have either removed or added a new DPM server to your environment?
It happened to me just the other day, I had to “re-think” my DPM design and starting using “Local” to each Data Centre DPM servers to backup my data at each Data Centre. However, this was not the case before this, we were using the same product, but a different strategy.</description>
