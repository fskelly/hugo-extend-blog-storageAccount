      <description>I have found a great for load testing SCSM with Incidents. The script uses SMLets to generate Incidents and you can then gauge how your system would handle the load you are planning within your Production Environment.
I will not go into the detail of the script as this blog post does a great job of explaining it. SO this got me to thinking about other Load Testing you could perform.</description>

      <description>I have previously done a post on CIreson IT Asset Management. However the people at Cireson have been very busy with new features to be added to their ITAM (IT Asset Management) tool.
Cireson Asset Management: New Feature Highlights
After recently releasing the newest version of the Asset Management app for Microsoft System Centre (Features Press Release), this post goes a little more in depth to explain some of the amazing features included in this latest release.</description>

      <description>Cireson have recently released an new enhancement to the Service Manager console called the Cireson SCSM Asset Management App. This particular application is very easy to install. To install the application into the console, it is simply a case of importing a few management packs and some XML files and DLL files. This is very easy to do and the installation instructions provided by Cireson are very simple and easy to follow as with all Cireson add-ins I have worked with in the past.</description>

      <description>With my previous post about importing data, I showed you how to use the built-in CSV connector to do this task and how to create the required Projection Classes. However if you are looking for a quicker more automated to achieve this, enter Cireson and their Asset Import Tool. It takes all the guess work out of the import process and handles the Projection Classes for you.
The installation of the application is easy and requires the copying a DLL file to the Service Manager Installation folder and the import of a Management Pack ( a management Pack Bundle in this case).</description>

      <title>Importing data into Service Manager–CSV import and XML</title>

      <description>So, just recently I was asked by a customer to import data from an “old” SCSM system. The customer is moving to new hardware within the organization and is using this opportunity to clean up Service Manager and re-import only clean data.So, the challenge is the following.The customer wants to import Change Requests from the “old” Service Manager to the “new” Service Manager. Ok, so after some research and confirmation, it is NOT possible to simply move data from one Service Manager installation to another.</description>

      <description>So, Cireson has been hard at work to fill a few gaps present within the Service Manager space. Cireson has created an application called My Active Work Items to bring all information assigned to your user token in one place. For Service Manager 2010, you could create the Work Items assigned to Me view. This was a good start for SCSM 2010 and this continues to work with SCSM 2012. However, with SCSM 2012, there are a few shortcomings of this view.</description>

      <title>Cireson Analyst Web Console</title>

      <description>I have always heard complaints from some of the analysts in my company about having to install the Service Manager Console on their machines and then complaining about having to learn a new application.
So, I went searching around and found a great application called Cireson SCSM Web Console, this allows analysts to update Incidents via a newly designed web portal for Analysts. Since the console is designed in HTML5, the web console is browser agnostic.</description>

      <title>AssignedTo and AffectedUser with Powershell – Service Manager</title>
      <link>https://cloudadventures.fskelly.com/2012/12/20/assignedto-and-affecteduser-with-powershell-service-manager/</link>

      <guid>https://cloudadventures.fskelly.com/2012/12/20/assignedto-and-affecteduser-with-powershell-service-manager/</guid>
      <description>So recently I got an e-mail to my newly setup e-mail address, for just this reason , from someone asking if I knew a way to do the following.
 “I was trying to find a way to find all Incidents related to a specific person (assigned to or affected user) using PowerShell” So, I decided the best to answer this with a blog post as maybe there are other people out there asking the same question.</description>

      <title>How do I “learn” System Center Service Manager 2012?</title>

      <guid>https://cloudadventures.fskelly.com/2012/12/14/how-do-i-learn-system-center-service-manager-2012/</guid>
      <description>So, I recently made a very simple comment on Facebook. This lead to some interesting comment and questions being raised about Service Manager about “Training for Service Desk” staff” in particular. At this moment in time, there is no “Service Desk Staff” training that I am aware of. So I decided to try and address this as best I could.I have decided to consolidate some of the more important components and concepts of Service Manager and place them in one spot.</description>

      <title>Auto-Closing work items made easy–Service Manager 2012</title>
      <link>https://cloudadventures.fskelly.com/2012/11/01/auto-closing-work-items-made-easyservice-manager-2012/</link>

      <guid>https://cloudadventures.fskelly.com/2012/11/01/auto-closing-work-items-made-easyservice-manager-2012/</guid>
      <description>So, there are a few ways of tackling the issue of automatically closing Incidents/Change Requests within Service Manager. Most of these solutions rely on a script leveraging SMLets. So you would create a script and then create a workflow and end up importing the Management Pack into Service Manager. The issue with this is the following, it is quite time consuming and should change under the hood with Service Manager, like the changes from 2010 to 2012, your script will most likely stop working.</description>

      <title>Exchange Connector – SCSM 2012</title>
      <link>https://cloudadventures.fskelly.com/2012/09/19/exchange-connector-scsm-2012/</link>

      <guid>https://cloudadventures.fskelly.com/2012/09/19/exchange-connector-scsm-2012/</guid>
      <description>So, I decided to extend the functionality of Service Manager even more with the Exchange Connector. If you follow the guide it is nice and easy to install. The configuration is quite simply as well, here is a link which gives the configuration in some detail to make you life a little. Once the connector is installed is when I found a little “gotcha” if you will. With the connector, it updates any incident with the same template, which can cause issues and potentially change your Priority and Urgency which can lead to some skewed reporting.</description>

      <title>Upgrading from SCSM 2010 / SCSM 2012 PRE-RTM to SCSM 2012 RTM</title>

      <description>So, You are now ready to take the plunge and upgrade to SCSM 2012 RTM as it now “publically” available.
There is great documentation, obviously, on TECHNET. I have however found out a few other things which will helpfully make your transition a little easier. I have found that the following can cause some complications and how to “mitigate” these if you will.
Service Manager 2010
Connectors – Please make sure that your connectors are NOT running while you do the upgrade, the upgrade will work, however your connectors will run and attempt to catch up with itself.</description>

      <title>Service Manager 2012 Management Server (Upgrade)</title>
      <link>https://cloudadventures.fskelly.com/2011/11/24/service-manager-2012-management-server-upgrade/</link>

      <description>So, for the Management Server.
This was very easy and quite painless for me.
 Backup Encryption Key (for Disaster Recovery Purposes) Install Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 (This is a pre-requisite for SCSM 2012) Remove Operations Manager Agent if this is installed, as the installer WILL stop you from continuing if the OpsMan Agent is installed. Run the Upgrade, PLEASE NOTE that if the Portal is installed on your Management Server, it will be REMOVED during the upgrade.</description>

      <guid>https://cloudadventures.fskelly.com/2011/11/22/service-manager-2012-data-warehouse-upgrade/</guid>
      <description>So, my journey with System Centre Service Manager 2012 Beta has begun and so far I have indeed found some funnies.
I will be blogging about them, to make everyone else’s life a little bit easier and in the hope of better product adoption for this product. It is simply put a fantastic product.
Ok, so the first time I ran the upgrade (remember I have a pre-prod environment), so I was able to rollback and did not have to follow Disaster Recovery with the Failure.</description>
