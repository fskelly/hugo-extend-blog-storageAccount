      <description>So what started this is actually quite simple. We have limited space on our virtual machines and the log files for IIS keeping filling up the drive on our Hub Transport Server (Exchange Server 2010). It is a little know fact, that a certain amount of free space on C: is needed on an Exchange Hub Transport Server, the magic number happens to be 15%. There are a few ways to solve the log file issue.</description>

      <description>Hi All,
It has been a really busy time for me. However, I am very happy with life at the moment. Just recently I received a “Microsoft Community Contributor” award from Microsoft.

I know I have been a little quite the last little while. I have been busy doing a job that everyone loves (I wish there was a font for sarcasm). I have been VERY busy documenting my production environment including Hyper-V, Active Directory and Exchange.</description>
