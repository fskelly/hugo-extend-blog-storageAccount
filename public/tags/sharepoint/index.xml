      <description>So, just recently I was asked to work yet another miracle.
The Scope.
  We need to go paperless.
  We need to move a certain form to an online platform and make it easy for users to fill in. With a custom picture and add checkboxes on top of that.
  We need this information to be saved onto a SharePoint site with unique filenames.</description>

      <description>I have finally found some time to look some more into DPM and decided to modify my environment and created some additional PROTECTION GROUPS. I am particularly chuffed as I have not done this before. Make no error, I have used DPM extensively for mailbox recoveries (Execs and other users crying about loosing items), recovering of databases and VHD (see some of my previous posts). So back to my point, the Protection groups were created without any hassle and now I have a dedicated SharePoint Protection Group.</description>
