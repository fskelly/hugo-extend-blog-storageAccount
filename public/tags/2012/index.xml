      <description>So, my journey with Windows Server 2012 has started. The primary focus of my company’s journey is Hyper-V3. So far, the results are impressive. We are running a cluster consisting of 4 nodes connected to a DAS.So, my lessons learnt so far.1. As per my previous article, be careful with your Hyper-V NICs. While I am discussing NICs, the inclusion of “Out the box” NIC Teaming is great and so far no issues at all.</description>

      <description>So, my journey with System Centre Service Manager 2012 Beta has begun and so far I have indeed found some funnies.
I will be blogging about them, to make everyone else’s life a little bit easier and in the hope of better product adoption for this product. It is simply put a fantastic product.
Ok, so the first time I ran the upgrade (remember I have a pre-prod environment), so I was able to rollback and did not have to follow Disaster Recovery with the Failure.</description>
