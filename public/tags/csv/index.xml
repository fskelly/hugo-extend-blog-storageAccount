      <description>With my previous post about importing data, I showed you how to use the built-in CSV connector to do this task and how to create the required Projection Classes. However if you are looking for a quicker more automated to achieve this, enter Cireson and their Asset Import Tool. It takes all the guess work out of the import process and handles the Projection Classes for you.
The installation of the application is easy and requires the copying a DLL file to the Service Manager Installation folder and the import of a Management Pack ( a management Pack Bundle in this case).</description>

      <description>So, just recently I was asked by a customer to import data from an “old” SCSM system. The customer is moving to new hardware within the organization and is using this opportunity to clean up Service Manager and re-import only clean data.So, the challenge is the following.The customer wants to import Change Requests from the “old” Service Manager to the “new” Service Manager. Ok, so after some research and confirmation, it is NOT possible to simply move data from one Service Manager installation to another.</description>

      <description>So, just last night, we had an issue with our cluster.One of our disks would not come online. We were seeing an error event ID: 1304 as below.
So, we began to investigate as all the Technet articles state that the drive is corrupted and Disk Signatures need to be changed, however we have had no major changes in the last little while. We were also able to view to CSV Volume from our SAN management tools.</description>

      <description>So, now you are at the point where you need to present a CSV Volume to your cluster.
I have created this guide to make your life a little easier. Doing this is actually quite simple, but there are a few gotchas.
Gotcha 1 : If you create / carve the LUN and forget to allow multiple access, only the first IQN / WWN will be able to access it.</description>
