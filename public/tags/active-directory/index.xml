      <description>I believe that the best way to improve your skill is to test and push yourself. I am currently on a mission to get a lot more comfortable with PowerShell ( as it lives up to its name, it is very POWERful).
I need to check a few domains up and running and like to keep an eye on my Domain Controllers as they are obviously the base of Active Directory.</description>

      <description>Hi All,
It has been a really busy time for me. However, I am very happy with life at the moment. Just recently I received a “Microsoft Community Contributor” award from Microsoft.

I know I have been a little quite the last little while. I have been busy doing a job that everyone loves (I wish there was a font for sarcasm). I have been VERY busy documenting my production environment including Hyper-V, Active Directory and Exchange.</description>
