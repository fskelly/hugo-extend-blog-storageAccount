      <description>Just recently I was running into some very strange issues with my Hyper-V Cluster. we have numerous NICs to allow for redundancy and better throughput for our clustered environment. We have a total of 11 NICs on our server to cater for Guest LAN, iSCSI, guest iSCSI (as we present SAN storage directly to the Guests), HeartBeat and Live Migration. So, I was getting a little concerned when I was performing maintenance and/or “Live Migrations” and my VMs were losing network connectivity both on LAN connections and iSCSI connections which was causing major issues with my VMs needing external storage as this was mostly SQL or file shares.</description>
