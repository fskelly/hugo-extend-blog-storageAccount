      <description>I have found a great for load testing SCSM with Incidents. The script uses SMLets to generate Incidents and you can then gauge how your system would handle the load you are planning within your Production Environment.
I will not go into the detail of the script as this blog post does a great job of explaining it. SO this got me to thinking about other Load Testing you could perform.</description>

      <description>Just recently I was looking for a way to notify users about Inactive incidents as I have some departments that tend to ignore their work items and an e-mail about their “untouched” incidents seems to motivate them. So after some searching I found this scriptfrom Andreas BaumgartenPlease note : I only modified this script to extend its use to other Statuses to be monitored. All credit for the script goes entirely to Andreas BaumgartenCode is below[sourcecode language=”powershell”]# Configure Last Modified Days Before</description>
