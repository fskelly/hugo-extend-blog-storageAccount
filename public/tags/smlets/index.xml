      <description>I always get asked about reporting from my customers, and specifically around SLA&amp;rsquo;s. SLA&amp;rsquo;s are very important to most companies as this is part of the tracking mechanism of employees and vendors and the like.
SMLETS is needed for this, it is built to be run from the server, if you need to run from your local machine, please install SMLets, copy the SDK Binaries folder and use the -computername where applicable with the SMLets commands.</description>

      <description>So recently I got an e-mail to my newly setup e-mail address, for just this reason , from someone asking if I knew a way to do the following.
 “I was trying to find a way to find all Incidents related to a specific person (assigned to or affected user) using PowerShell” So, I decided the best to answer this with a blog post as maybe there are other people out there asking the same question.</description>

      <description>Would you like a nice graphical breakdown of all calls logged in (x) days and there status?
I know I would. So, of course I have been working on such a script using smlets v3.
So far, this is what the script does.
 Takes the current date and time and subtracts 7 days and presents you with a nice HTML output which is mailed to the user. (Both the date and time and who to mail the output to is configurable.</description>

      <description>In my previous post, SCSM And Powershell, I mentioned that I am now starting to play with get-scsmobject. In this post I also created a script. That script has now been evolved into a proper get-scsmobject script.$Now=(get-date).AddDays(-7)
$CId=(Get-SCSMEnumeration -ComputerName &amp;quot;ms-ec-hdm01&amp;quot;IncidentStatusEnum.Closed$).id
$RId=(Get-SCSMEnumeration -ComputerName &amp;quot;ms-ec-hdm01&amp;quot;IncidentStatusEnum.Resolved$).id
$Class=Get-SCSMClass -ComputerName &amp;quot;ms-ec-hdm01&amp;quot;System.WorkItem.Incident$$cType=&amp;quot;Microsoft.EnterpriseManagement.Common.EnterpriseManagementObjectCriteria&amp;quot;#$cString = &amp;ldquo;Status != &amp;lsquo;$CId&amp;rsquo; and Status != &amp;lsquo;$RId&amp;rsquo; and TargetResolutionTime &amp;lt; &amp;lsquo;$Now&amp;rsquo; and TargetResolutionTime Is Not Null&amp;rdquo;$cStringClosed=&amp;quot;Status = &amp;lsquo;$CId&amp;rsquo;and CreatedDate &amp;gt;&#39;$Now&amp;rsquo;&amp;quot;$cStringResolved=&amp;quot;Status = &amp;lsquo;$RId&amp;rsquo;and CreatedDate &amp;gt;&#39;$Now&amp;rsquo;&amp;quot;$cStringAll=&amp;quot;CreatedDate &amp;gt;&#39;$Now&#39;&amp;quot;$critClosed=new-object $cType$cStringClosed,$Class$critResolved=new-object $cType$cStringResolved,$Class$critAll=new-object $cType$cStringOther,$Class$closed=Get-SCSMObject -ComputerName &amp;quot;ms-ec-hdm01&amp;quot;-Criteria $critClosed$resolved=Get-SCSMObject -ComputerName &amp;quot;ms-ec-hdm01&amp;quot;-Criteria $critResolved$all=Get-SCSMObject -ComputerName &amp;quot;ms-ec-hdm01&amp;quot;-Criteria $critAll#$all = Get-SCSMObject -ComputerName &amp;ldquo;ms-ec-hdm01&amp;rdquo; -Class (Get-SCSMClass -ComputerName &amp;ldquo;ms-ec-hdm01&amp;rdquo; System.</description>

      <description>Hi all,
i have been playing with SMLets3 and get-scsmobject and using information from the post by Travis Wright, Using SMLets Beta 3 Post #1 – Using Get-SCSMObject, Get-SCSMClass to Dump Data from SCSM. This is an amazing post and I have been able to create a script that queries all Cases created after a certain date. It then gives you the breakdown of Open, Closed, Resolved and other status cases, which is then e-mailed to you.</description>

      <description>Hi All,
The last two weeks have been a little nutty for me. I have however, learnt to appreciate a few more things in life.
  No matter how good your planning for DR, there is always that one thing that catches you. We have a generator, which is great. Now, when we cutover from generator power to mains power and then the main building power trips, life becomes interesting.</description>
