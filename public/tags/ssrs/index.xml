      <description>So, we have started our migration from ConfigMgr 2007 R2 to SCCM 2012. We have installed the new site and now we have started building the required collections as we are using a mix of old collections from ConfigMgr 2007 ( a lot of the built-in collections that are present in ConfigMgr 2007 are NOT present in SCCM 2012. So of course, copy and paste of the Query language is quite useful and this is one of the first things I would do when you are in the process of a SCCM Migration.</description>
