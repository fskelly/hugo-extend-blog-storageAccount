      <description>So, recently I decided to take the plunge and upgrade to SCOM 2012. So, there were a few pre-requisites that I needed as per the prereq checker that is built into OpsMan 2012.The “big ones” were as follows. 1. OpsMan 2007 R2 CU52. And FTS (Full Text Search) for SQL. So, these seem easy enough to fix. 1. Simple downloadCumulative Update 5 for System Center Operations Manager 2007 R2and install. To be honest, I found this articlesuper helpful for the installation of this Cumulative Update, nice and easy to follow.</description>

      <description>Hi All,
I know it has been a little while.
The reports built into Service Manager are great, however when you try to get a bit creative and automate some of the reports, you are going to run into some issues. So to work around theses issues, I did the following.
Create a custom report from SQL Reporting Services and modified for my needs, I was focusing more on “Incident Analyst” and I was looking for a breakdown of the number of Incidents per Analysts in a week period.</description>

      <description>Do you ever have those days where it just starts bad and gets worse?
“Man Alive, what a day it has been and it is not over yet”
First, simple network change, enabling DHCP helper on our new Infrastructure. Sounds simple, right?. Well, our switches are stacked for connectivity and storage, so a reboot of the switches means shutting down the environment, IP and iSCSI. So I go and do this, not knowing about our cluster needing 3 nodes active, what a mission.</description>
