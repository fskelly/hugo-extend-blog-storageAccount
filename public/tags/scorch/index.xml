      <description>So, I am quite a keen user of PowerShell and System Centre Orchestrator. Ok, so I recently had a request from a customer that went as follows “I need DPM to alert me when tapes are ready to be taken off-site.”
DPM does not seen to have this functionality out of the box within the Graphical User Interface (GUI). All is NOT lost, Data Protection Manager has a PowerShell component and i was sure i could figure out a way to get this to work within PowerShell.</description>

      <description>Just recently in a test environment, a script or some such other gremlin caused some absolute havoc on my system. Before you ask, I had NO Backup in place of this system. This system was System Center Orchestrator. However, once a week, I do a “sort-of” backup. By this, I mean I export all my Runbooks and place a copy on my local machine and a file server and the SCORCH (System Center ORCHestrator) server.</description>

      <description>So what started this is actually quite simple. We have limited space on our virtual machines and the log files for IIS keeping filling up the drive on our Hub Transport Server (Exchange Server 2010). It is a little know fact, that a certain amount of free space on C: is needed on an Exchange Hub Transport Server, the magic number happens to be 15%. There are a few ways to solve the log file issue.</description>

      <description>So, just recently I decided to install System Centre Orchestrator. It appears easy enough if you follow the Technet articles. This addresses the need for Service Accounts and the permissions needed by these accounts and there functions. It also helps you to size and decide the Orchestrator installation type that would best suit your environment. It helps you to decide the best way to break the components if you want to.</description>
