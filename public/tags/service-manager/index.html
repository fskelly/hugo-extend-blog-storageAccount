                I have previously done a post on CIreson IT Asset Management. However the people at Cireson have been very busy with new features to be added to their ITAM (IT Asset Management) tool.
Cireson Asset Management: New Feature Highlights
After recently releasing the newest version of the Asset Management app for Microsoft System Centre (Features Press Release), this post goes a little more in depth to explain some of the amazing features included in this latest release.

                Cireson have recently released an new enhancement to the Service Manager console called the Cireson SCSM Asset Management App. This particular application is very easy to install. To install the application into the console, it is simply a case of importing a few management packs and some XML files and DLL files. This is very easy to do and the installation instructions provided by Cireson are very simple and easy to follow as with all Cireson add-ins I have worked with in the past.

                I have always heard complaints from some of the analysts in my company about having to install the Service Manager Console on their machines and then complaining about having to learn a new application.
So, I went searching around and found a great application called Cireson SCSM Web Console, this allows analysts to update Incidents via a newly designed web portal for Analysts. Since the console is designed in HTML5, the web console is browser agnostic.

                So, I recently made a very simple comment on Facebook. This lead to some interesting comment and questions being raised about Service Manager about “Training for Service Desk” staff” in particular. At this moment in time, there is no “Service Desk Staff” training that I am aware of. So I decided to try and address this as best I could.I have decided to consolidate some of the more important components and concepts of Service Manager and place them in one spot.

                So, in an effort to get my business ready for Service Requests as we use mainly Incidents and we are beginning our journey into Service Requests and differentiating between Service Requests (day to day operations) and Incidents (something is broken), I needed to reproduce a workflow to notify the “AssignedToUser” when a new Service Request is assigned to him or her. I already had a downloaded Management Pack for Incident Re-assignment notifications which was modified for my purposes, so this was a good place to start.

                So, I have been running Service Manager for quite some time now. From SCSM 2010 to SCSM SP1 and most of the CU’s before I upgraded to SCSM 2012 Beta and RC and then to RTM (with the help of a Microsoft TAP Program). Service Manager is now quite entrenched in our business and has been running quite well for a very long time. However, a little while ago we began to experience performance issues with the Console and the logging of calls and the application of Workflows.

                So, You are now ready to take the plunge and upgrade to SCSM 2012 RTM as it now “publically” available.
There is great documentation, obviously, on TECHNET. I have however found out a few other things which will helpfully make your transition a little easier. I have found that the following can cause some complications and how to “mitigate” these if you will.
Service Manager 2010
Connectors – Please make sure that your connectors are NOT running while you do the upgrade, the upgrade will work, however your connectors will run and attempt to catch up with itself.

                So now, I move onto the final part of the SCSM 2012 journey, the Portal.
The install was pretty straight-forward, the most difficult part is deciding how you would split your roles or if you are going to split your roles, here is the guide for role placement.
So, once you have decided which route you would like to follow, here are the steps I followed.
 Start the setup.

                So, for the Management Server.
This was very easy and quite painless for me.
 Backup Encryption Key (for Disaster Recovery Purposes) Install Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 (This is a pre-requisite for SCSM 2012) Remove Operations Manager Agent if this is installed, as the installer WILL stop you from continuing if the OpsMan Agent is installed. Run the Upgrade, PLEASE NOTE that if the Portal is installed on your Management Server, it will be REMOVED during the upgrade.

I will be blogging about them, to make everyone else’s life a little bit easier and in the hope of better product adoption for this product. It is simply put a fantastic product.
Ok, so the first time I ran the upgrade (remember I have a pre-prod environment), so I was able to rollback and did not have to follow Disaster Recovery with the Failure.

                Hi All,
I know it has been a little while.
The reports built into Service Manager are great, however when you try to get a bit creative and automate some of the reports, you are going to run into some issues. So to work around theses issues, I did the following.
Create a custom report from SQL Reporting Services and modified for my needs, I was focusing more on “Incident Analyst” and I was looking for a breakdown of the number of Incidents per Analysts in a week period.
