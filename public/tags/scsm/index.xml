      <title>Service Manager 2012 Management Server (Upgrade)</title>
      <link>https://flkellyneucloudblogpre.z16.web.core.windows.net/2011/11/24/service-manager-2012-management-server-upgrade/</link>

      <description>So, for the Management Server.
This was very easy and quite painless for me.
 Backup Encryption Key (for Disaster Recovery Purposes) Install Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 (This is a pre-requisite for SCSM 2012) Remove Operations Manager Agent if this is installed, as the installer WILL stop you from continuing if the OpsMan Agent is installed.</description>

      <description>Hi All,
I know it has been a little while.
The reports built into Service Manager are great, however when you try to get a bit creative and automate some of the reports, you are going to run into some issues.</description>
