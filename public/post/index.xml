      <description>What else do I need to know when using Azure VMware Solution (AVS)?
Networking Edition
I have been working with many customers over the last little while that are looking at Azure VMware Solution (AVS).
Often the idea and use case for the customer is correct. There are a few great reasons to use AVS. If you fit within the use cases, you are in for a real treat.
Deciding whether or not you are a fit is part of the equation, there is more to this scenario.</description>

      <description>Just some more queries I have developed.
Networking Don&amp;rsquo;t create unnecessarily large virtual networks (for example, /16) to ensure that IP address space isn&amp;rsquo;t wasted.
resources| where type == &amp;quot;microsoft.network/virtualnetworks&amp;quot;| extend addressSpace = todynamic(properties.addressSpace)| extend addressPrefix = todynamic(properties.addressSpace.addressPrefixes)| mvexpand addressSpace| mvexpand addressPrefix| extend addressMask = split(addressPrefix,&#39;/&#39;)[1]| where addressMask &amp;lt;= 16Smallest recommended size for a GatewaySubnet is /27
When you are planning your gateway subnet size, refer to the documentation for the configuration that you are planning to create.</description>

      <description>Azure Resource Graph Examples ðŸ˜„
 Azure Resource Graph   --This is just a quick post. I am slowly working on building a collection of Resource Graph Queries - they can be found here and will grow over time. It just takes some time to build these.
They will be broken down into a folder structure based upon the Critical Design Areas of Enterprise Scale Landing Zone

      <description>Some basic &amp;ldquo;troubleshooting&amp;rdquo; with Azure Bicep So, let me start with this. The team and the community behind Azure Bicep are amazing. There are some great examples here. I often use these as a base and the rip apart or add to meet my needs, you do NOT need to start from ground zero. ðŸ˜„
When you are deploying bicep templates you command will look something like this.

      <description>How to use the Azure CLI to list Azure Locations and their peers So this will be a &amp;ldquo;quick post&amp;rdquo; that shows some great functionality within the Azure CLI with az account list-locations. With this command you can expect some output like below, you actually get a lot of content back.
{ &amp;#34;displayName&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;Brazil Southeast&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;id&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;/subscriptions/949ef534-07f5-4138-8b79-aae16a71310c/locations/brazilsoutheast&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;metadata&amp;#34;: { &amp;#34;geographyGroup&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;South America&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;latitude&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;-22.90278&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;longitude&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;-43.2075&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;pairedRegion&amp;#34;: [ { &amp;#34;id&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;/subscriptions/949ef534-07f5-4138-8b79-aae16a71310c/locations/brazilsouth&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;name&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;brazilsouth&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;subscriptionId&amp;#34;: null } ], &amp;#34;physicalLocation&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;Rio&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;regionCategory&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;Other&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;regionType&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;Physical&amp;#34; }, &amp;#34;name&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;brazilsoutheast&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;regionalDisplayName&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;(South America) Brazil Southeast&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;subscriptionId&amp;#34;: null } If you look at some of the examples, you will also see some &amp;ldquo;logical&amp;rdquo; locations, example below, there is a way of adding a query to remove these to display only &amp;ldquo;physical&amp;rdquo; locations.</description>

      <title>Azure Rest Api Postman Basics</title>

      <description>Absolute basics with Azure and PostMan Getting started Many of the articles I have found online with regards to the Azure REST API assume a fair level of familiarity with Azure which can be a good and bad thing. You see the Azure Portal makes interacting with the Azure REST API very easy as a lot of the &amp;ldquo;prerequisite&amp;rdquo; work is done in the portal as part of the process. For this blog post we will work on something quite basic, &amp;ldquo;Create a Virtual Machine&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>Expiring Keys and Secrets within Azure Key Vault</title>

      <description>I was working with a customer the other day and a fairly simple ask came up, I however could not find an immediate answer within the portal.
How do I check for expiring keys within the Azure KeyVault?
Now being a PowerShell person, I never gave this much thought as for most tasks or actions I perform on the Azure Platform is done through PowerShell, AP, or CLI. So easy enough, however, not everyone knows how to do this in PowerShell.</description>

      <description>I moved my blog onto HUGO. Not everyone would want to do this necessarily, there is a bit of a learning curve, part of the reason I DID IT :). However there are other platforms you can use and still add more functionality if you want.
You can use Ghost and add an Azure CDN. This is what this blog post will cover.
There are some very clever people out there that have made this very easy for you.</description>

      <description>So, I have spent the last few days / weeks deciding the best way to host a blog. Now I have a decidedly &amp;ldquo;split personality&amp;rdquo;. By this I mean I like to segregate my work and personal hobbies. This can be quite beneficial as this allows me to test a few things.
A few key decisions  Must be version controlled - good practice and forces me to get more familiar with git.</description>

      <description>As a start to this blog post, I think it is important to understand how I see my role as a CSA (Cloud Solution Architect) with my customer. I am primarily a trusted advisor and my customers respect what I have to say, I question and challenge my customers in a constructive way to approach the challenge or problem statement in a different way. I have an amazing role of using Azure as my LEGO playpen and then building a custom solution (LEGO model) to help my customers.</description>

      <guid>https://cloudadventures.fskelly.com/p/csa-tools-of-the-trade/</guid>
      <description>So a question I often get asked is &amp;ldquo;what tools or products do you use?&amp;rdquo;. So I decided to do a post around the tools and technologies that I personally use on a daily basis. So to start this is what people see on my screen on a daily basis.
VSCode
This is my most common tool, Visual Studio Code, the version shown above is actually theÂ Insiders Build.</description>

      <title>Network Security Group Change Alerting</title>

      <guid>https://cloudadventures.fskelly.com/p/network-security-group-change-alerting/</guid>
      <description>So, I was with a customer and they are asking for a fairly standard alert.
&amp;ldquo;Please alert me when an NSG is added or modified&amp;rdquo;. Seems simply enough, however this is not as simply as you think. So I used my favourite search and found the following, â€œHow to receive an email on Azure Network Security Group Rule changesâ€œ, this is great content and after testing, it works exactly as expected.</description>
