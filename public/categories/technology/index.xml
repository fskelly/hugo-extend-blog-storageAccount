      <description>Hi All,
It has been a really busy time for me. However, I am very happy with life at the moment. Just recently I received a “Microsoft Community Contributor” award from Microsoft.

I know I have been a little quite the last little while. I have been busy doing a job that everyone loves (I wish there was a font for sarcasm). I have been VERY busy documenting my production environment including Hyper-V, Active Directory and Exchange.</description>

      <title>Microsoft Word, SharePoint, a Form and NO InfoPath on Server</title>

      <description>So, just recently I was asked to work yet another miracle.
The Scope.
  We need to go paperless.
  We need to move a certain form to an online platform and make it easy for users to fill in. With a custom picture and add checkboxes on top of that.
  We need this information to be saved onto a SharePoint site with unique filenames.</description>

I have taken the get-hotfix and tweaked it so something useful for my environment.
I have uploaded the .ps1 file to Technet.

Hope you find this helpful.

      <title>Building more redundancy and replicating folder structure</title>

      <description>We have had a few failures of the power kind (thanks to the electricity provider in South Africa, who will remain nameless). So we have now had to build in further redundancy to cater for this and for other business needs. There is nothing worse than getting a phone call saying that critical services are unavailable at a CRITICAL time. What a nightmare. So a few plans were set in motion.</description>

      <title>Changing your Protection Server in DPM to another server</title>

      <description>Have you ever been in a situation where you have either removed or added a new DPM server to your environment?
It happened to me just the other day, I had to “re-think” my DPM design and starting using “Local” to each Data Centre DPM servers to backup my data at each Data Centre. However, this was not the case before this, we were using the same product, but a different strategy.</description>

      <title>To Protect or NOT to Protect</title>

      <description>I have finally found some time to look some more into DPM and decided to modify my environment and created some additional PROTECTION GROUPS. I am particularly chuffed as I have not done this before. Make no error, I have used DPM extensively for mailbox recoveries (Execs and other users crying about loosing items), recovering of databases and VHD (see some of my previous posts). So back to my point, the Protection groups were created without any hassle and now I have a dedicated SharePoint Protection Group.</description>

      <title>POWERshell console to power all plugins</title>

      <guid>https://cloudadventures.fskelly.com/2011/05/20/powershell-console-to-power-all-plugins/</guid>
      <description>I do not know about everyone else. I am a rather busy admin and quite fond of powershell and scripting. However, I also have a separate admin account for doing my administrative tasks. Now when you are working with multiple systems, all of which have PowerShell consoles, it can become a little bit of a pain opening a console for Exchange 2010, Operations Manager 2010, Virtual Machine Manager and Service Manager to name a few.</description>

      <description>In my previous post, SCSM And Powershell, I mentioned that I am now starting to play with get-scsmobject. In this post I also created a script. That script has now been evolved into a proper get-scsmobject script.$Now=(get-date).AddDays(-7)
$CId=(Get-SCSMEnumeration -ComputerName &amp;quot;ms-ec-hdm01&amp;quot;IncidentStatusEnum.Closed$).id
$RId=(Get-SCSMEnumeration -ComputerName &amp;quot;ms-ec-hdm01&amp;quot;IncidentStatusEnum.Resolved$).id

      <description>Hi All,
The last two weeks have been a little nutty for me. I have however, learnt to appreciate a few more things in life.
  No matter how good your planning for DR, there is always that one thing that catches you. We have a generator, which is great. Now, when we cutover from generator power to mains power and then the main building power trips, life becomes interesting.</description>

      <description>I decided to yet again sue Bitlocker, even knowing the previous experencies i have with it. It previously cost me all my data, however i had backed up all my data. I am sure by now you know where this is going. So, the weekend just past i decided to Encrypt my Hard Drive using BitLocker. I am not sure what i did to piss off Murphy, but as usual with me and BitLocker something went wrong.</description>
