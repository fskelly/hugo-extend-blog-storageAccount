      <description>So, I am quite a keen user of PowerShell and System Centre Orchestrator. Ok, so I recently had a request from a customer that went as follows “I need DPM to alert me when tapes are ready to &amp;ldquo;be taken off-site&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>So one of the biggest issues I have with Service Manager is actually user based as seems to be quite difficult to teach the concept of this for some strange reason.</description>

      <description>So, we have started our migration from ConfigMgr 2007 R2 to SCCM 2012. We have installed the new site and now we have started building the required collections as we are using a mix of old collections from ConfigMgr 2007 ( a lot of the built-in collections that are present in ConfigMgr 2007 are NOT present in SCCM 2012.</description>

      <description>Just recently I was looking for a way to notify users about Inactive incidents as I have some departments that tend to ignore their work items and an e-mail about their “untouched” incidents seems to motivate them.</description>

      <title>Service Requests – Re-assignment notification</title>

      <guid>https://flkellyneucloudblogpre.z16.web.core.windows.net/2012/07/09/service-requests-re-assignment-notification/</guid>
      <description>So, in an effort to get my business ready for Service Requests as we use mainly Incidents and we are beginning our journey into Service Requests and differentiating between Service Requests (day to day operations) and Incidents (something is broken), I needed to reproduce a workflow to notify the “AssignedToUser” when a new Service Request is assigned to him or her.</description>

      <description>So, I have been running Service Manager for quite some time now. From SCSM 2010 to SCSM SP1 and most of the CU’s before I upgraded to SCSM 2012 Beta and RC and then to RTM (with the help of a Microsoft TAP Program).</description>

      <description>Hi All,
