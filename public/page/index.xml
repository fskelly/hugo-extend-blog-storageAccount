      <description>Who Am I? I am a Microsoft Employee, working within Azure Engineering as a FastTrack For Azure (FTA) Engineer, focusing primarily on Infra and working with customers across the globe with their respective journeys to the cloud. I was previously a Cloud Solutions Architect (CSA) for Microsoft as well. I was in the Microsoft Partner space for many years before that.
