You can also check for non-expiring keys. Can be run within the Cloud Shell  For me, it is equally important to check for expiring keys, for key rotation there is a process to do this.

Must be reliable and redundant, or at least enough to re-deploy if needed - see point 1 :) . Must be as cheap as possible to run and be fairly quick. Must be a learning experience.  Points 1 and 2 makes git a natural choice. Point 3 makes Azure or GitHub Pages a natural choice.

Not everyone would want to do this necessarily, there is a bit of a learning curve, part of the reason I DID IT :). However there are other platforms you can use and still add more functionality if you want.\nYou can use Ghost and add an Azure CDN. This is what this blog post will cover.\nThere are some very clever people out there that have made this very easy for you. From my research you have 2 main options.\n A \u0026ldquo;simple Web App\u0026rdquo; More complex deployment with Containers and a CDN - now this sounds interesting.  For this post I naturally focused on option 2 :). A BIG shoutout goes to Andrew Matveychuk. I am all about \u0026ldquo;Standing on the shoulders of giants\u0026quot;. I used his repo and then forked it into mine. He has a nice blogpost on his journey. I simply unpacked this a little further and went into some more details and highlight some of the potential gotchas and setting up things in more detail with specific focus on the Azure Portal.\nDeployment The deployment is nice and easy thanks to a one-click deploy - thanks again Andrew Matveychuk.\n   It \u0026ldquo;deploys\u0026rdquo; pretty quickly but, of course, this is just the start of the work.\nDuring deployment During the deployment of the application you will see the Web App change.\n Almost  Success!!!\nYou will see something SIMILAR to this.  Gotcha with Container Deployment The solution takes a while to deploy - this seems to be due to some changes made recently by Docker. Do NOT be hasty like I was, this can cause issues and create the need for a re-deploy. Instead lets use the logs to see what is going on :)\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s find the log I was talking about.\n We are waiting for this entry  So, now to add move value, we can add an Azure CDN (in this case, this has already been done) and look at configuring your own custom name for this.\nA content delivery network (CDN) is a distributed network of servers that can efficiently deliver web content to users. CDNs' store cached content on edge servers in point-of-presence (POP) locations that are close to end users, to minimize latency.\nSo we can add a custom domain to a CDN to make this more pretty and give your site a more more friendly name - you can move away from the https://xyz.azurewebsites.net, I definitely think a custom domain is far cleaner and \u0026ldquo;more professional\u0026rdquo;. So let\u0026rsquo;s dive in and get this done. :)\nSo, there a few steps to get this done. This is well documented here, however I will provide more context and give some sample screenshots.\nWe have some DNS Settings to configure as per the above article. Below, I have added some sample for the CDN demo I configure for this blog.\n Create the required verification entries in your DNS Zone. I use ClouDNS but the process is the same, just how you create the required entries will vary with each provider.  This process should not take too long, but now we want a certificate and the joys of TLS Start the verification process   Domain Verification   Create a certificate   And completed    Now here is the end result - note the HTTPS 👍  Follow me,\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\n","permalink":"https://flkellyneucloudblogpre.z16.web.core.windows.net/posts/2021/azure-ghost-cms-and-cdn/","tags":["azure","cdn","CMS"],"title":"Azure Ghost CMS and Azure CDN"},{"categories":null,"contents":"As a start to this blog post, I think it is important to understand how I see my role as a CSA (Cloud Solution Architect) with my customer. I am primarily a trusted advisor and my customers respect what I have to say, I question and challenge my customers in a constructive way to approach the challenge or problem statement in a different way. I have an amazing role of using Azure as my LEGO playpen and then building a custom solution (LEGO model) to help my customers.\nSo, of late I have been having a lot of networking discussions with my customers. Now these discussions have been ranging from a new customer to a very advanced customer that has been using Azure for quite some time. These have also ranged from new connection options to extend their on-premises connectivity into Azure, which we call \u0026ldquo;Hybrid Connectivity\u0026rdquo;, as well as networking considerations once in the cloud with Azure Native connectivity such AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) and ACI (Azure Container Instances) to simply name the current most top of mind topics.\nSo, having these discussions is not an uncommon practice and these are the types of discussions that should be happening, there is nothing wrong with this. All that is happening more and more often is that these discussions are happening in isolation as opposed to the customer working on having a holistic approach to this discussion and working on a full cloud networking solution.\nYou cannot necessarily think of networking in silos anymore. Yes, networking can be silo\u0026rsquo;ed and many people do this. However with the \u0026ldquo;new world\u0026rdquo; of cloud and the networking associated to this concept, networking is now a critical point on your cloud journey. There are multiple options available here as a start. THe main role of a Cloud SOlutions Architect or more importantly a trusted advisor, is to understand the requirements of your customer and work with the required teams, usually networking, InfoSec, business owner and Application owner to determine the correct networking option for the cusotmer.

Once all the information was gathered, I joined all the files to create a final file containing all the information, all I can say here, is that you are going to spend a fair amount of time looking at HTML code (or at least I did), I highly recommend both BlueGriffon and NotePad++ to assist with this. To get the SLA information, I used the $System.WorkItemHasSLAInstanceInformation$ class to get the SLA information with another switch to cater for an item that has no SLA. I also looked at the history to retrieve the $LastModifiedDate$.\nTo get all the information I needed into a manageable format, I used a custom PowerShell Object and added all the information into the object. From an object the data can be easily manipulated into the required format. Basically I write the information from each object out into individual files to meet the customer\u0026rsquo;s needs and then combine these HTML files (hence spending a lot of time ensuring all my HTML Tags were properly closed) into one complete HTML file as well.\nFor the emailing of the information, you need to specify the \u0026ldquo;TO\u0026rdquo;, the rest I gather from the system itself, as we know the relay that the server is using can send messages and the \u0026ldquo;FROM\u0026rdquo; address will be correct.\nFollow me,\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\n","permalink":"https://flkellyneucloudblogpre.z16.web.core.windows.net/posts/history/2015-08-27-sla-reporting-with-powershell-and-scsm/","tags":["SLA","SMLets","PowerShell"],"title":"SLA Reporting with PowerShell and SCSM"},{"categories":["Operations Manager","PowerShell","System Center"],"contents":"So, here is the scenario, we managed a lot of customer’s System Centre Operations Manager (SCOM) environments.

By this, we simply mean connecting to the agent, stopping the “SCOM” service, deleting the content of the “Health Service State” folder and then restarting the “SCOM” service.\nYes, this is a perfect candidate for PowerShell and their a quite a few scripts that do this in numerous ways using PowerShell, I have a script for this, but they are usually dependant upon a list of some and then loop through this, I decided to use my friend, System Centre Orchestrator (SCO) to facilitate this is in a time manner, with more flexibility and log building as well as inputting the results into a database. With SCO, we also have more avenues available to us for error handling, like logging a call within SCSM or “richer” email or the like.\nSo, I have learnt with SCO, the best thing to do is to actually sit down and whiteboard you solution, simply draw out the steps you want to follow and think of some error handling.

The Console is super easy to install. The Install instructions are provided by Cireson. There are a few steps to follow as well as the installation of an Outlook Plugin.\nYes, as you may have guessed from the name, this allows you to connect to Service Manager with almost a full experience directly from OUTLOOK, how great is that. It simply sits in a corner and connects automatically or it can be set not to, if you are like me and always traveling and do not always have connection to your SCSM Environment. I have tested with extensively, it works VERY WELL over Mobile Broadband (please note that I am in South Africa, the broadband here is NOT great) with a VPN Connection.\nYes, you read that correctly, it is configured in such a way to be light enough to use or a mobile connection with a VPN connection to your environment. Like I said, well worth the wait.\nSo, once the installation is complete and the Management Packs have been imported and the Outlook Plugin has been installed, the fun can start.\nOk, so onto configuring the Outlook Client,\nClick Settings  Configure as needed, you will notice that I have configured some of the features, like \u0026ldquo;When Outlook starts, disable features and don\u0026rsquo;t connect\u0026rdquo;, i have done purely because i am NOT domain joined and do not always want the Outlook Console to always try and connect especially when I am NOT connected to my corporate environment in any way, this can be easily set and configured to meet your needs. I also enable the the \u0026ldquo;Prompt for Credentials when connecting\u0026rdquo;, if I do not do this, it will try to connect using NON DOMAIN credentials. Cireson have clearly thought of this scenario. 🙂\n So, now we can connect to the Environment.\n Provide the required username, password and domain.\n The connection is usually made quite quickly and you can easily see when the connection has been made as a few more icons will now appear and allow you to start using the real power of the Outlook Connector.\n Very quickly, you can see that you can easily Create, Edit and see you Active Work Items. The connector is very intuitive, and easy to use. Simply click one the buttons above or right click on an e-mail, this allows you to create or update a Work Item (yes, you can do this for Problems, Incidents, Changes and Service Requests). This outlook connector really is a ONE-STOP shop for everything Service Manager related.\nCreation is easy, and the subsequent menu are easy to understand\n As is editing an incident,\n With the Edit, it allows to search for the Work Item and then modify the required Work item.\n The Outlook Console has a very familiar look and feel to it, allowing pretty much all the same functionality as the Native SCSM Console. When it comes to tasks and the like, such as resolving, you will notice that there is NO context pane for these tasks. However, this is solved by Cireson, with the use of a \u0026ldquo;Tasks drop down\u0026rdquo;, allowing for the simplest tasks do to completed as efficiently as possible.\n Notice the tasks,\n All tasks like re-assignment work in much the same way as the Native SCSM Console, also allowing for searching as you type.\n Once all the required updates and/or tasks have been completed, simply click apply or OK, whichever you normal use.\nMore Functionality You can also use email received by you to log calls.\nSo, here is the scenario, you normally allow people to send email and then the call gets logged, or you get an e-mail directly from a user. This should be a new call or perhaps an update to an existing call, the [Cireson Outlook Console][2] handles this with ease. The [Cireson Outlook Console][2] allows you to update or log Work Items directly from Outlook.\nWhat is also very nice and handy is that the linking of the Affected user happens automatically, the \u0026ldquo;From\u0026rdquo; is used for the \u0026ldquo;Affected User\u0026rdquo;, in the same way that the Exchange Connector for SCSM works.\n   All required Fields completed, OK button is now available.\n Updates to work Items are handled in pretty much the same way, select the e-mail, Right Click -\u0026gt; Service Manager -\u0026gt; Choose to Update or add to Work Item. Search for Work Item and and Click OK.\n  OK, so you clicked \u0026ldquo;OK\u0026rdquo; and t disappeared, how do I check?\nVery easy, you can use the \u0026ldquo;Edit\u0026rdquo; option and search for Incident and you can check it was added as a log.\n   A lot of though has gone into this product, I ALWAYS recommend this product to my customers, as most of us spend the majority of our time within Outlook as it is, this simply adds the immense power of System Centre Service Manager into Outlook as well, allowing you to further empower your IT Staff.\nFollow me,\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\n","permalink":"https://flkellyneucloudblogpre.z16.web.core.windows.net/posts/history/2014-06-17-cireson-outloook-console/","tags":["SCSM","Cireson"],"title":"Cireson Outlook Console"},{"categories":["System Center","Orchestrator"],"contents":"Hi All,\nIt has been a little while, i have been quite involved with an Integration Project. With this project there was a requirement to add comments to a Work Item. The information is passed on from \u0026ldquo;System A\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;System B\u0026rdquo; via XML. Using PowerShell, extracting the XML contents is not too difficult, if anyone would like to dive into that a little bit, please let me know with Comments.\nI decided not to re-invent the wheel, so some searching was in order, and I found the following post, this post gave the basics. However every time I tried to add additional comments, the comments were over-written and NOT replaced. Not quite the desired effect. So after some more checking and research and tinkering within the Service Manager, I discovered the following about comments.\nWhen adding a Comment, there is adding of a relationship class, already mentioned in this post, however it also uses a GUID.\n There is also another trick to adding comments within Orchestrator, this is discovered by trying to add a comment and then pulling all the available fields and looking at them. It is a small component which can be easily missed. The \u0026ldquo;Display Name\u0026rdquo; must also be the same GUID. So you might be asking how do we get the GUID?\nWell, PowerShell can easily handle this for you.\n$guid = [System.Guid]::NewGuid().ToString() You simply use this a pre-cursor step and publish this data from \u0026ldquo;Run .Net Script\u0026rdquo;, so a sample would look like this.\n Get-Object Properties\nI pass on the ID Value I want to modify from another Runbook\n Create Related Object Properties\nI use an \u0026ldquo;Extended\u0026rdquo; class of comments needed for this project, principal remains the same.\n I hope this saves you some time and add some value.\nFollow me,\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\n","permalink":"https://flkellyneucloudblogpre.z16.web.core.windows.net/posts/history/2014-04-04-adding-comments-to-work-items-with-orchestrator/","tags":["SCSM","Integration Project","Orchestrator","PowerShell"],"title":"Adding Comments to Work Items with Orchestrator"},{"categories":["System Center","PowerShell"],"contents":"So recently, I had a customer ask me for the following as their previous incident management system had this functionality.\nThe customer wanted to be able to send an \u0026ldquo;Update Email\u0026rdquo; to a 3rd party from the SCSM Console with automatically placing the reference number into said email. They needed the functionality of sending to any email address. This was a requirement for the type of business they are in.\nPlease remember that I am by no means a developer. I was thinking of using System Centre Orchestrator, however for this simple requirement, I thought that it might be overkill. I am sure that in time, as the requirements grows and/or changes, System Centre Orchestrator will become a better fit. For this solution, I turned to my friend, PowerShell\nI simply wanted to provide a clean interface for the customer to use. I follow a strict rule of KISS (Keep It Straight and Simple). With the PowerShell script, I provide two input fields.\n Email address of user for update to go to Update to be sent to customer.  The screenshot of what the window looks like\n All of this was built in PowerShell with some from [Sapien PrimalForms Community Edition][3] to assist with the GUI part. The GUI is fully functional and tested. \u0026ldquo;Send Update\u0026rdquo; is responsible for sending the update to the specified person and the \u0026ldquo;Cancel\u0026rdquo; simply closes the form nicely and allows you to continue as normal.\nPowerShell Code Below SendEmail\n#region Script Settings #\u0026lt;ScriptSettings xmlns=\u0026#34;http://tempuri.org/ScriptSettings.xsd\u0026#34;\u0026gt;

Now, it is time to create the console task. This is a fairly straight forward exercise. There are only a few tips I would like to share. I used a shared folder for the scripts and then mapped the console task to the shared folder.\nI have configured the PowerShell script to use a parameter, the ID of the Work Item, this is very easy to configure and ensure that the parameter is passed on. See below.\n You will see that I used the \u0026ldquo;Log in action log when this task is run\u0026rdquo;. That is where the Write-host in the PowerShell script becomes handy, the write-host lines are added to the Action Log.\nPlease feel free to use and modify to meet your needs.

All is NOT lost, Data Protection Manager has a PowerShell component and I was sure I could figure out a way to get this to work within PowerShell. Sure enough a solution in the form of PowerShell was [found][4], so using this as a base, I modified the PowerShell script to suit my needs. It was also slightly modified to use with System Centre Orchestrator. The custoemr also wanted some colour and wanted the result formatted in HTML. primarily for reading purposes and auditing purposes.

They wanted a way to connect to all the switches within their environment and then run some commands against the switch after connecting to the switch on port 23. Once the connection has been made, then some commands are run to get the current running configuration. Then export this to a text file.\nSo I found a basic script here and copy of script. I have since taken this and modified and extended the script. I have added an array for the IPs to be checked. I have also added some checking prior to running any commands. I have added some testing.\nFirst, we test the connection and see if the device is responding to pings. If the device is responding to pings, then test and see if the device is configured for telnet. So basically I am looking to see if port 23 is open. If port 23 is not opened, a log file is updated with the IP Address. If the device is not responding to pings, a log file is updated stating the IP of the \u0026ldquo;non-responding\u0026rdquo; device.\nAs an addition to the script, the files are then added to an e-mail which is sent to whomever you want to add. As part of the email process, a check is done and if an error is thrown, there is more information presented in the console to point you in the correct direction.\n# PowerShell: Script To Telnet To Remote Hosts And Run Commands Against Them With Output To A File ##  # Overview: Useful for Telnet connections to Cisco Switches and other devices.

The script uses SMLets to generate Incidents and you can then gauge how your system would handle the load you are planning within your Production Environment.\nI will not go into the detail of the script as this blog post does a great job of explaining it. So this got me to thinking about other Load Testing you could perform. The most common Load Test is with Incidents. However, i decided that another good load test would be Service Requests. What is nice about this load test, is that it uses a Management Pack which I have included in this post. The Management Pack contains a Service Request Template with a Manual Activity added as the first Activity. This will allow you to test Service Requests and well as Activities, which would in turn, test any workflows or runbooks that you have configured.\nFor my environment, I have additional runbooks which are also triggered when Manual Activities are completed or when Review Activities are completed. So with this Load Test script it also test my runbooks and other workflows.\nRemember, to set a different Implementer for the Manual Activity to allow the runbooks or workflows to be triggered off correctly. Remember, no Manual Activity Implementer or if the implementer has no email address, your emails will not be triggered correctly.

However the people at Cireson have been very busy with new features to be added to their ITAM (IT Asset Management) tool.\nCireson Asset Management: New Feature Highlights\nHighlighted below are a few of notable enhancements, including the Cireson full Asset Catalogue, Location to IP Awareness, Contract Management and Reporting.\nThe full Asset Catalogue found within the Cireson Asset Management app allows users to define standard hardware types, as well as information such as model, manufacturer, and price. With access to a comprehensive yet simple and informative page view with all the relevant information in one place, users can better manage the standardization of asset types no matter what the scale of the organization.\nLocation to IP Awareness is now also an incredibly exciting feature. This function tracks where hardware assets exist, and also allows for hardware to location awareness based on IP address – information which is provided by System Centre 2012 Configuration Manager. This is a great example of how Cireson works to utilize all System Centre components in order to provide the most insightful and rich experience possible.\nExpanding on the extensive Contract Management capabilities of the Asset Management app, the new version boasts the ability to perform full contract management with different types of contracts that relate to various software and hardware assets under management. Support and maintenance contracts, leases, and warranties represent the main areas of contract management. Highly unique to the Cireson app is the ability to manage contract status via a built-in SLA engine, with notifications upon near breach or expiration of a contract’s end date.\nIn addition, the superior reporting functions of this new version allows for comprehensive reporting based on asset data from the data warehouse and cube reporting engine within Service Manager. These rich out-of-the-box reporting solutions cover contract, hardware asset, license, and software asset reports, amongst others.\n Other enhanced capabilities of the Cireson Asset Management app now include, app metering data tracking against software asset types to understand installation vs. utilization vs. purchased count, and over 250 brand new features that make the System Centre Service Manager experience better than ever before.\nFor more information, videos, and overviews relating to Cireson Asset Management for System Centre, visit the app store at Cireson\nFollow me,\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\n","permalink":"https://flkellyneucloudblogpre.z16.web.core.windows.net/posts/history/2013-08-27-new-featurescireson-it-asset-management/","tags":["ITAM","Cireson"],"title":"New features–Cireson IT Asset Management"},{"categories":["Service Manager","Service Manager Portal","EUPSCO","Orchestrator"],"contents":"So, let’s ay you have invested the time and gotten System Centre Orchestrator up and running in your environment and you have the product performing some day to day tasks and it is working well. However, now you want start using SCO (System Centre Orchestrator) to start performing end user focused tasks like Password Reset, add users to groups or even disabling of users or server testing as part of first line support.\nAll of these tasks can be completed within orchestrator, however exposing them to the end user can be a little tricky. It can be done, the “native way” of performing this within the System Centre Suite is to use System Centre Service Manager with the Service Manager Orchestrator Connector and then prompt the user for information and kick off runbooks. This particular scenario works well if you have System Centre Service Manager in place, and a future blog post will cover the idea of “adding a user to an Active Directory group” as part of a Service Request. There are a few challenges around this. Firstly, you need SCSM (System Centre Service Manager) and some time and patience to test the connectors and runbooks and to create the correct templates and ensure that Workflows with SCSM are configured correctly within SCSM. Like I have said previously, this solution works and it works well!!!\nIn reality though, not everyone has SCSM in place, many of my companies customers are in the progress of migrating to SCSM and these systems are still in testing or QA or UAT, whatever the case may be, they are NOT in production YET! However, these companies still want this the functionality listed above. Yes, there is a way!!!\nEnter EUPSCO, the full name is End User Portal System Centre Orchestrator, and as the name suggests it creates an End User Portal for System Centre Orchestrator. This allows the IT Department to create the required runbooks, to for example, ping a server or reset a password or disable an account. This creates the “Menu”, called “Services” within the End User portal. Once this is completed, the end user can then order from this menu and get the required results without the need of having to contact the IT Department. This particular tool is very easy to install and the guide (NOT AVAILABLE anymore - reach ou to them directly) is easy to follow. The End User portal requires NO SilverLight and as such, it is compatible with most browsers. I have personally tested with the IE, Chrome, Safari and Firefox, all working without issue.\nThe application also reads from Active Directory, this helps with your reporting line allowing a Manager of staff members (Determined by “Manager” in Active Directory) to log requests on the behalf of his/her staff members, so now +a manager can log a request to reset the password of his/her staff member. The application also allows for approvals. So each service can have an approver, the service allows for a runbook to be triggered if an Approver’s input is needed, with mine, I simply kick off a runbook, which sends an email to the approver with a link to the End User Portal and his/her requests allowing him/her to approve or deny the request.\nThis should help your organization adopt System Centre Orchestrator more easily.\nFollow me,\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\n","permalink":"https://flkellyneucloudblogpre.z16.web.core.windows.net/posts/history/2013-08-05-end-user-portal-for-system-centre-orchestrator/","tags":["ITAM","Cireson"],"title":"End User Portal for System Centre Orchestrator"},{"categories":["Service Manager"],"contents":"Cireson have recently released an new enhancement to the System Centre Service Manager console called the Cireson SCSM Asset Management App. This particular application is very easy to install. To install the application into the console, it is simply a case of importing a few management packs and some XML files and DLL files. This is very easy to do and the installation instructions provided by Cireson are very simple and easy to follow as with all Cireson add-ins I have worked with in the past.\nIn order to get the full benefit from the Cireson SCSM Asset Management App, I would highly recommend that the [Configuration Manager Connector][4] be enabled within your environment. However, this is NOT a necessity. Within my environment as I run mine as a Lab, it is not always possible to have all the connectors enabled all the time. I was very easily able to configure my workflows (come with the Cireson SCSM Asset Management App to work and pull in the required information.\nA sample of my workflow configuration is below. The workflows and settings for the Cireson SCSM Asset Management App are found under the Administration Wunderbar and then settings as with all Cireson applications.\nThere are settings for both Software and Hardware Collections.\nSoftware  Hardware  A little lower down on the Hardware tab, this is where the Configuration Manager Connector would add a tremendous amount of value as you can reference different value to be used as a Hardware ID. So, if you had the Configuration Manager Connector enabled, you could reference a Serial Number or Asset Tag. However, it is perfectly feasible to reference Principal name.\n Under the \u0026ldquo;Miscellaneous \u0026ldquo;tab, is where the logging is configured, which is amazingly helpful for troubleshooting.

However if you are looking for a quicker more automated to achieve this, enter Cireson and their Asset Import Tool. It takes all the guess work out of the import process and handles the Projection Classes for you.\nThe installation of the application is easy and requires the copying a DLL file to the Service Manager Installation folder and the import of a Management Pack ( a management Pack Bundle in this case). The instructions provided with the application are very clear and concise.\nAs usual with the Cireson applications, the settings for the applications can be found and tweaked in the Administration | Settings. This time, this is where the License Key will need to be entered.\n So now, onto the “meat”. Let’s actually use the application and see how it works. The application works pretty much the same way as the CSV Connector. It is classified as a connector, and as such to use it, a new connector would need to be created. Connectors are found under Administration | Connectors\n If you have any Projection or Combinations classes you would like to use the application does allow the use of this.  For this demo, I have used the Windows Computer Class, additional information around the Projection classes, this will allow to see the information (headers) used by the required class. The Windows Computer class has the following information.\n   Name Type MinLength MaxLength AutoIncrement     PrincipalName string 0 256 False   DNSName string 0 256 False   NetbiosComputerName string 0 256 False   NetbiosDomainName string 0 256 False   IPAddress string 0 256 False   NetworkName string 0 256 False   ActiveDirectoryObjectSid string 0 256 False   IsVirtualMachine string 0 256 False   DomainDnsName string 0 256 False   OrganizationalUnit string 0 256 False   ForestDnsName string 0 256 False   ActiveDirectorySite string 0 256 False   OffsetInMinuteFromGreenwichTime int (range: [-2147483648, 2147483647]) 0 256 False   LastInventoryDate datetime 0 256 False   ObjectStatus enum:System.ConfigItem.ObjectStatusEnum 0 256 False   AssetStatus enum:System.ConfigItem.AssetStatusEnum 0 256 False   Notes richtext 0 256 False   DisplayName string 0 256 False    So, for this, I will bulk import a few computers with only a few simple parameters.\nI am simply adding two machines\n The Asset Import Tool also allows you to test your configuration first.\n Now we can map the Headers to the Projections, you will see I kept them the same, however if you are getting a file from the IT Department or any other department, this step here allows to map these correctly.\n Next, you can set your frequency, allowing you to automate the import. I have configured mine to run Every Hour.\n Then you can create the connector. Final Connector completed.\n Now lets run it!!!!\n Since we enabled the option to “Test”, the results were written to a log file allowing us to test before running in a production environment.\n All looks good, let’s run it to bring in the data. A simple change needs to be made. We just need to remove a checkbox.\n Ok, change made. let’s import the data. So now, let’s re-run the import process.The Connector has now re-run, now we can check the data. This time without the testing.\n Now, we can see the new imported data. We can check here under Configuration Items | Computers | All Windows Computers\n And there we have it, importing nice and easy.\nFollow me,\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\n","permalink":"https://flkellyneucloudblogpre.z16.web.core.windows.net/posts/history/2013-05-17-import-ci-items-with-cireson-asset-import-tool/","tags":["ITAM","Asset Import","CSV Import","Cireson"],"title":"Import CI Items with Cireson Asset Import Tool"},{"categories":["Service Manager"],"contents":"So, just recently I was asked by a customer to import data from an \u0026ldquo;old\u0026rdquo; SCSM system.

It is designed to ask any set of questions, this is of course configurable.

As seen below, the questions are easy to configure and can be presented in \u0026ldquo;User” English making this an easy application to present to end-users. The application allows for the configuration of up to 10 questions. A toggle to count “No” instead of “Yes’ is also provided.

It presented an error stating that \u0026ldquo;Could not find any resources appropriate for the specified culture or the neutral culture\u0026rdquo;.\nI have never seen an error like this before, so it was time to do some investigating.\nI started by looking at the Data Warehouse Wunderbar and more specifically the “Data Warehouse Jobs” tab.

I was digging through the Event Logs, when I found the following error\nEvent id: 33410\nSource : Deployment  And as you can see from the screenshot, there are plenty of these. Clearly the patching window had interrupted a job. So now with at least something to work with, I started looking around some more and remembered that the MPSyncJOB is responsible for Management Pack Synchronization and upon opening the status of this job, I saw that the Management Packs related to the now problematic cubes were dissociated].\nSo, from here it was time to check and start putting the pieces of the puzzle together. Upon opening the “Management Pack” section of the “Data Warehouse” Wunderbar, I could see that the deployment of these Management Packs had failed.

Cireson has created an application called My Active Work Items to bring all information assigned to your user token in one place. For Service Manager 2010, you could create the Work Items assigned to Me view. This was a good start for SCSM 2010 and this continues to work with SCSM 2012. However, with SCSM 2012, there are a few shortcomings of this view. The Work Items assigned to Me, it only shows some very limited information and this view cannot be edited.  Please make no error, this view is helpful and can provide the required information. It is still context driven on the right hand pane.\nBut now, enter My Active Work Items. Below is a screenshot to give you an idea of how it looks. I will then look at individual aspects.  If you have multiple work items of the Same type, For example, Incidents, they will be grouped together. In the Screenshot below, I have created 2 incidents to demonstrate this.  the pane below the “My Active Work Items” provides all information needed about the highlighted work item at a glance.  All the other features associated to the Highlighted work item are available as a right click context item. I will show a few examples below.\nIncident  Review Activity  Problem  Change Request  Also note the \u0026ldquo;My Active Work Items\u0026rdquo; context menu which allows easy to the creation of any type of Work Item.  The installation and configuration of My Active Work Items is very simple and quick. The installation instructions provided are clear and concise and the settings, found under Administration –\u0026gt; Settings can be easily tweaked and changed to suit your needs.\nIf you have looked at my previous [Cireson Group Assign][13] post, you will see that the AD Groups leveraged within that Service Manager application can be leveraged again.

Before you ask, I had NO Backup in place of this system. This system was System Center Orchestrator. However, once a week, I do a “sort-of” backup. By this, I mean I export all my Runbooks and place a copy on my local machine and a file server and the SCORCH (System Center ORCHestrator) server.\nI was planning to perform an upgrade to System Center 2012 Service Pack 1, and as it happens according to the Upgrade Sequencing for System Center 2012 SP1, SCORCH was the first Product that needed to be updated.\nSo, at this moment in time, I had a non-functioning SCORCH server and a backup of the Runbooks from the server WITHOUT a proper backup. Luckily the use of SCORCH at this moment in time was mainly for timed tasks and Runbooks triggered by folder changes.\nSo, I had to rebuild the server. These are the steps I followed and it worked out for me.\nNB!!!! Please note that is NOT a replacement for a backup, having a proper backup plan is crucial to any environment. Once my SCORCH server was back up and running, I immediately implemented a proper backup procedure using Microsoft System Center Data Protection Manager in addition to the backup of Runbooks. I am currently working on a Runbook to backup my Runbooks, more to follow on that soon. To achieve this goal, I will be using an Orchestrator Codeplex runbook.\nAnyways, back on topic.

Once the Runbooks are imported. You will then need to check the Runbooks. You will need to re-register and re-deploy the integration packs.\n  Once all the Runbooks are registered and deployed, your environment will be backup and running.\n  If you have a Connector within System Center Service Manager, you will need to check and ensure that the Run As account is working as expected.\n  Follow me,\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\n","permalink":"https://flkellyneucloudblogpre.z16.web.core.windows.net/posts/history/2013-02-04-recover-system-center-orchestrator-2012-with-runbooks-export/","tags":["Runbook","Recover"],"title":"Recover System Center Orchestrator 2012 with runbooks export"},{"categories":["System Center Service Manager","System Center"],"contents":"I have always heard complaints from some of the analysts in my company about having to install the Service Manager Console on their machines and then complaining about having to learn a new application.\nSo, I went searching around and found a great application called Cireson SCSM Web Console, this allows analysts to update Incidents via a newly designed web portal for Analysts. Since the console is designed in HTML5, the web console is browser agnostic. This face also helps some companies to adopt this as it allows analysts to use all types of devices to update incidents.\nThe guide provided to install the application is Comprehensive and easy to follow. Just make sure you do all the steps. I have added some screenshots of errors I got along the way, trying to \u0026ldquo;jump the gun\u0026rdquo; and see the new Web Console in action.\n\u0026ldquo;Issues and Errors\u0026rdquo; I ran into, all of which are easily fixed.\nServer error in \u0026lsquo;/\u0026rsquo; Application  This error is pretty much self-explanatory, I tried to open the console before the Cireson Management Pack had been imported. A simple fix, import the Management Pack.\n Again, this looks intimidating. This is very easy to fix if you look at error. When you are going through the installation guide, it is very easy to miss a step. Like this, when configuring the web.config file with Active Directory Connector information, it is very easy to find the space for the DN Name of your domain. When the above happens, it is simple a case of not adding the full DN for a DOMAIN CONTROLLER.\nBut now, onto the console in action. Just one side note, for now the Cireson SCSM Web Console handles only incidents, I have heard that plans are in progress for the Cireson SCSM Web Console to be extended to include Service Requests and potentially Problems, WOW!!!!!!\nThe Cireson SCSM Web Console is really easy to navigate and very easy to understand, anything you can do in the actual console, you can do on the Cireson SCSM Web Console. So, if you make the Cireson SCSM Web Console publically available, your Analysts can update from anywhere with any device as the Web Console is NOT dependent on Microsoft Silverlight.\nAs you can see below, the Web Console is very nicely put together and gives you all the information you need at a quick glance.  You can click an incident to open it and you will be presented with some detailed information regarding the incident as can be seen below. You can also \u0026ldquo;Edit Incident\u0026rdquo; from the Web Console to update it.  From the top Level Tabs, you can see you access all the information you could regarding Incidents  Below are screenshots of each \u0026ldquo;Section\u0026rdquo; from the Top Level Menu\u0026quot;\nIncidents can also be LOGGED from the Web Console, displaying all information from your SCSM Implementation  The \u0026ldquo;My Team\u0026rsquo;s Incidents\u0026rdquo; leverages the groups and information provided during the installation of the Web Console and provides a consolidated view of the Incidents assigned to the \u0026ldquo;Support Group\u0026rdquo; to which the currently logged on user is a member and this works very nicely with Cireson SCSM Group Assign  The \u0026ldquo;All My Incidents\u0026rdquo; View provide a view of all incidents assigned to the currently \u0026ldquo;logged on\u0026rdquo; user.  The \u0026ldquo;All Incidents\u0026rdquo; view provides an overview for all incidents within your Service Manager environment. By default, only active incidents are shown, you can select the checkbox to show resolved incidents.  The \u0026ldquo;Search Incidents\u0026rdquo; views allows you to search via a number of different fields, making it really easy to find any incidents you are looking for.  The \u0026ldquo;Configuration Items\u0026rdquo; view is the representation of the CI Items within the organization on the Web Console.  The Cireson SCSM Web Console is a great addition to your Service Manager environment. It allows incidents to be updated quickly and easily from any device.

So, as a work-around I have created views that cater for the issue I am about to discuss.\nThe issue is as follows, when a Work Item gets re-assigned to a new Analyst, 99% of the time, the associated Support Group does NOT get changed. Let’s take the following example.\n An incident is logged and is automatically assigned to the “Service Desk” team, now an analysts investigates the incident and determines that the incident actually belongs to a member of the “Network Team”. So, typically, the “Assigned to” person is changed and the new analyst will get an e-mail stating that a call has been assigned to him/her. However, the incident now reflects the following\n Analyst -\u0026gt; Changed\nNetwork Analyst -\u0026gt; NOT changed\nSo basically, if you were to have a queue or view that shows up all incidents assigned to the “Network Team”, this incident would not show up however the analyst has received and e-mail stating that an Incident has been assigned to him/her, it can of course be found by using “Assigned to Me” View.\nThere is a solution here. Enter Cireson and their fantastic applications for Service Manager. SCSM Group Assign allows the extended functionality of selecting the required Support Group and then NARROWS the list of Analysts to that specific group. This ensures that BOTH theSupport Group andAnalyst are changed at time of re-assignment, making the creation of views and Queues a lot simpler and then ensures that your views based on Support Group are 100% accurate. The solution extends the context pane and adds a \u0026ldquo;Assign Analyst by Group\u0026rdquo; option\n What SCSM Group Assign allows you to is the following (this is my test lab), you will however get the idea.\nBelow is a screenshot of the groups that I have created within Active Directory to “illustrate” my different Support Groups. You will see a few groups.\n For all analysts To represent different support Groups (I have called them Tier 1,2 and 3, as this is the vanilla experience with SCSM)   Ok, so below is a screenshot of a re-assignment using the new “Assign Analyst by Group” option. For this example I have used “Tier 1”. Note how the “Analyst” selection is limited to only 2 Analysts as per my groups earlier. Namely Analyst 1 and Analyst 2.\n The next screenshot depicts the same process only to “Tier 2” this time. This time the selection is limited to Analyst 3 and Analyst 4.\n The re-assignment is logged in Service Manager in the exact same way as any analyst assignment. This is an extension of the capabilities of Service Manager.\nI would highly recommend SCSM Group Assign for any Service Manager installation.\nFollow me,\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\n","permalink":"https://flkellyneucloudblogpre.z16.web.core.windows.net/posts/history/2012-12-31-group-assignment-with-service-manager/","tags":["SCSM","Assigned to user","Assignment"],"title":"Group assignment with Service Manager"},{"categories":["System Center","Service Manager"],"contents":"\u0026ldquo;I am trying to find a way to find all Incidents related to a specific person (assigned to or affected user) using PowerShell\u0026rdquo;\nSo, I decided the best to answer this with a blog post as maybe there are other people out there asking the same question. This is a quick solution using PowerShell\nget-scsmincident At this moment in time, this will address ONLY incidents. I will work on some code using PowerShell to reference all work items. I will add the pieces of code as I go and explain the code.\nget-scsmobject First lets start by importing the required module, SMLets can be downloaded here\nimport-module smlets\nI am running these commands on a computer that is NOT the Management Server. So I need to specify a computer name when I am running these commands. So, in the next line I create a $computername variable to make my life easier. If you are running these commands on the Management Server, you can remove the piece of code. Below is how I created this, please use the name of your Management Server\n$computername = \u0026#34;name of your Management Server\u0026#34; Ok, so now lets get all active incidents. I will run a PowerShell Command to get all Incidents that are NOT EQUAL to \u0026ldquo;Resolved\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Closed\u0026rdquo;. This allows us to cover all other incident statuses you may have created. Notice the –ne operator.\n$allincidents = Get-SCSMIncident -ComputerName $computername | Where-Object {$_.Status -ne \u0026#34;resolved\u0026#34; -and $_.status -ne \u0026#34;closed\u0026#34;} So now we have all the incidents in an object, now what????\nPersonally, I choose to sort the information, enter Sort-Object with Powershell. So, to elaborate a little further you can use get-member or \u0026ldquo;GM\u0026rdquo; for short and \u0026ldquo;pipe\u0026rdquo; your variable to \u0026ldquo;GM\u0026rdquo;\n$allincidents | gm  $allincidents | get-member  Now you have a list of all the properties you can use. You can also go deeper into the ‘Members’ of the object. You can do the following as well\n$allincidents.affecteduser | gm  It is simply a case of playing around and digging a little bit.\nSo now back to the\nSort-Object I wanted to sort by AssignedTo user, this can be easily changed by changing the\n-Property field of the\nsort-object I also chose for this example to display the information in a useful grid. This too can be changed as needed.\n$allincidents | Sort-Object -Property Assignedto | Select-Object -Property ID, Displayname, AffectedUser, Assignedto | Out-GridView You will get some results like the below.  You can also limit the results by \u0026ldquo;Assigned To\u0026rdquo; user like such using either\n-like or\n-eq operators. Examples below\n-like operator. The example is finding all calls assigned to a user where the name is like \u0026ldquo;Kok*\u0026rdquo;. This time without the \u0026ldquo;out-gridview\u0026rdquo;\n$allincidents | Where-Object {$_.assignedto.displayname -like \u0026#34;kok*\u0026#34;}  -eq operator. This example finds all incidents assigned to a user with a specific name. In my example I am using \u0026ldquo;Desmond Hilton\u0026rdquo;\n$allincidents | Where-Object {$_.assignedto.displayname -eq \u0026#34;Desmond Hilton\u0026#34;}  The PowerShell code can be easily adapted to meet the requirements for the \u0026ldquo;Affected User\u0026rdquo;. We simply change the value to use with the current object like such. I use\n$Get-member on \u0026ldquo;Affecteduser\u0026rdquo;\n$allincidents.affecteduser|gm .

We have limited space on our virtual machines and the log files for IIS keeping filling up the drive on our Hub Transport Server (Exchange Server 2010). It is a little know fact, that a certain amount of free space on C: is needed on an Exchange Hub Transport Server, the magic number happens to be 15%. There are a few ways to solve the log file issue. I found this solution. This deletes all files older than 7 days. This can, of course, be modified to suit your needs, I personally have chosen 14 days. Some people choose more, it is basically a case of whatever works best for.I could simple set this a scheduled task and allow this to run every few days and keep the log files to a reasonable size. However, I have orchestrator and was thinking that this would be a great chance to get my hands dirty and start to show the benefit of Orchestrator to some of the staff in our IT department. I know those that know Orchestrator, are saying “you have to convince them how good Orchestrator is?” and the answer is a resounding “YES”. Anyways, back onto topic here. Below is a diagram of the orchestration. I will go into more detail around my thinking for each step. Hopefully someone can learn from this and help drive the value of System Centre Orchestrator \nSo, the first bit is simply a monitor allowing you specify how often you would like the Runbook to Run.\n\nNext up, is a simple “Disk Space” monitor found under “Monitoring”\nI have configured the parameters as needed.\nI also tweaked the security parameters as needed to an account that has the required rights for checking Drive Space on the required server.\nFor the next step, I modified the “Link Properties” to match my needs of checking of the Disk Space to return a value that will allow the rest of the Runbook to run. It is simply a case of Clicking “Add” and then selecting the required values to check for. I chose “Percentage of Space Available” from Component Before “is less than” Desired percentage.\nThis is why I chose to create a runbook, my staff and Company like to be informed of any changes made on servers. So now I send an e-mail stating that the free space is low to the necessary recipients.\nNow, I create a folder to allow for creation of text files for the logging of which files will be deleted. (more on this later)\nI also use published data from earlier in the Databus to create unique folders based on date and time.\nNow, I create a list of all the files to be deleted and read them into a “log file” and place them in the folder created above for “Auditing” purposes. I had to run this through a PowerShell script and there are some limitations with Orchestrator and Impersonating another account within PowerShell. I will continue to work on this to clean it up.Please note that subscribeddata means data from earlier up the Databus, namely folder locations.\nI run the below PowerShell script.This reads the files to be deleted, older than 14 days, creates a log file, and reads the log file into the body of the e-mail.[sourcecode language=”powershell”]net use H: *subsribeddata* /user:europcar\\administrator $files=get-childitem -Path \\ms-ec-exc01\\C$\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles -recurse | where-object {$_.lastwritetime -lt (get-date).addDays(-14)}| out-file -filepath \u0026ldquo;H:\\logs.txt\u0026rdquo; -append$body = (get-content *subscribeddata\u0026gt;*logs.txt -encoding ASCII | out-string)send-mailmessage -attachments \\logs.txt -body $body -to \u0026ldquo;fletcher.kelly@europcar.co.za\u0026rdquo; -from \u0026ldquo;orchestrator@europcar.co.za\u0026rdquo; -subject \u0026ldquo;Files to be deleted\u0026rdquo; -smtpserver 172.21.195.69net use h: /delete[/sourcecode]\nNow it is time to delete the actual files\n[sourcecode language=”powershell”]net use H: *subsribeddata* /user:europcar\\administrator *password* $files=get-childitem -Path \\ms-ec-exc01\\C$\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles -recurse | where-object {$_.lastwritetime -lt (get-date).addDays(-14)}| remove-item –recursenet use h: /delete[/sourcecode]\nNow it is time to check the Disk Space is at an adequate level.\nModify the link Properties again to meet new requirements. So, I have tweaked the script to ensure that the free space is now above my threshold ( I have set mine to 15%)\n\nAnd then finally send an e-mail stating that the free space is now adequate. Tweaked to meet my needs with Subscribed data in the body and subject.\nPlease note that this information is provided as is. I can assist as much as possible. Please TEST, TEST and TEST again.Hope this helps,Follow me.\n","permalink":"https://flkellyneucloudblogpre.z16.web.core.windows.net/2012/12/06/exchange-log-file-monitoring-orchestration/","tags":["Exchange","IIS","Logs","Orchestration","Orchestrator","SCORCH"],"title":"Exchange Log File Monitoring Orchestration"},{"categories":["Service Manager"],"contents":"So, there are a few ways of tackling the issue of automatically closing Incidents/Change Requests within Service Manager. Most of these solutions rely on a script leveraging SMLets. So you would create a script and then create a workflow and end up importing the Management Pack into Service Manager. The issue with this is the following, it is quite time consuming and should change under the hood with Service Manager, like the changes from 2010 to 2012, your script will most likely stop working. You can look at the TechNet Gallery for replacement scripts. So, here enters something new I have found compliments of Cireson, a nice FREE tool which allows for easy configuration of “Auto-Close” not just of Incidents but of Work Items in General. Takes a few minutes to download and even easier to setup.

So of course, copy and paste of the Query language is quite useful and this is one of the first things I would do when you are in the process of a SCCM Migration.Next up boundaries, at least the new version reads Active Directory and then creates the boundaries for you. We are creating custom Boundary groups so suit our needs as we have quite a mix of “FAST” and “SLOW” WAN links. So far so good, starting to push out clients and get them reporting to the new site. This is going well and can be time-consuming. So, we decided to install the Reporting Point so we can get some decent reports from the system. By now, it is late on Friday and I decide to push out the installation to a whole collection I have created and allow time over the weekend for the clients to install and report nicely back to SCCM.So, naturally on Monday morning I want to open the console and see how my “Client Push” went and I was greeted with the following.Not exactly want you want to see. So after some more digging around I found this in the event log.\nAnd what is really strange is that nothing had changed over the weekend and this is a brand new install and I was able to open the console on Friday afternoon to push out the clients. So, now for some troubleshooting, checked SPN’s with this article, Check!!! no changes and still I cannot connect to the main site.So now time for some more digging. I now decided it was time to look at this from an SCCM Log point of view. For this, I opened SMSProv.log from the machine I was trying to connect to the console.

However if you use additional “NON-DEFAULT” statuses, this would need to be modified to suit your needs. You would need to modify the line of code to read as follows.[sourcecode language=”powershell”]$IncidentStatus = ‘Enum.847741a452db4d529741005ea73aead8′[/sourcecode]\nand [sourcecode language=”powershell”]$Status = Get-SCSMEnumeration $IncidentStatus$[/sourcecode]\nYou will notice the change of $IncidentStatus to a “ENUM” Value as this is a “NON-DEFAULT” value, you need to use the ENUM value. This can be gotten by using the following with SMLets[sourcecode language=”powershell”]Get-SCSMEnumeration | Format-list | out-file[/sourcecode]\nBelow, is a screenshot to help illustrate this further.\nOnce you have a list of all your Enumerations, then search for the required value, for example “Pending – Waiting for 3rd Party”, you will then see a “Name” value and that whole string is your ENUM value.You will also see that the $Status line has been changed to cater for the ENUM value.Modify to meet your needs and create a workflow if you want to.Follow me.\n","permalink":"https://flkellyneucloudblogpre.z16.web.core.windows.net/2012/10/10/inactive-incidentse-mail-assigned-to-user/","tags":["Assigned to user","Assignedto","e-mail","notification","reminder","Service Manager","ServiceManager","workflow"],"title":"Inactive Incidents–E-mail assigned to User"},{"categories":["Service Manager"],"contents":"So, I decided to extend the functionality of Service Manager even more with the Exchange Connector. If you follow the guide it is nice and easy to install. The configuration is quite simply as well, here is a link which gives the configuration in some detail to make you life a little. Once the connector is installed is when I found a little “gotcha” if you will. With the connector, it updates any incident with the same template, which can cause issues and potentially change your Priority and Urgency which can lead to some skewed reporting. So I asked this question on the forums and Andreas came up with a clever solution. The use of an “empty template”. I have since implemented this and it works well. The “Empty Template” does not modify any of your Tiers, Classifications or Impact or Urgency or any such settings. By doing this it allows me to use only the core functionality as I want to.I was primarily interested in “First Response”, “Resolution”, “Updating” and closure of incidents and service requests. This solutions works VERY well for me and I would highly recommend this solution.\nOne last gotcha, if you want to modify the details on the connector from a console not on the server, remember to copy the dll’s used in the installation to the machine hosting the console.Hope this helps,Follow me. \n","permalink":"https://flkellyneucloudblogpre.z16.web.core.windows.net/2012/09/19/exchange-connector-scsm-2012/","tags":["Exchange connector","SCSM","SCSM 2012","SMTP"],"title":"Exchange Connector – SCSM 2012"},{"categories":["Hyper-V"],"contents":"So, my journey with Windows Server 2012 has started. The primary focus of my company’s journey is Hyper-V3. So far, the results are impressive. We are running a cluster consisting of 4 nodes connected to a DAS.So, my lessons learnt so far.1. As per my previous article, be careful with your Hyper-V NICs. While I am discussing NICs, the inclusion of “Out the box” NIC Teaming is great and so far no issues at all. Works well and allows us to simplify the administration of our Virtual switches and allows for more tolerance in terms of the loss of a NIC. Before, should we loose a NIC, all VMs attached to that NIC would loose connectivity, that is now a thing of the past and our NIC Teaming is fully supported by Microsoft. NICE!!!2. Increased VHD hard drives, this is achieved by introducing a new type of file format called a .VHDX which allows for “Virtual Hard Drives” larger than 2TB. This works nicely and I have personally created a few VHDx’s larger than 2TB. There is no little “gotcha”, or at least this was in my environment. The creation of this .vhdx file is rather time-consuming and very IO intensive with a DAS. I will try to remember to update you when I try this same procedure on my Equallogic SAN. However, for now, I would recommend you test this process first and see if you run into the same IO issues as I did, before creating numerous .vhdx’s in your production environment.3. Virtual CPU increase. This has been particularly helpful with our process of creating a new environment. It is quite amazing how much more “CPU” can help with this. Finally I could create a VM with over 2TB of usable space in one drive and have more than 4 vCPU’s, what a pleasure. So I would create my “Core Services” and throw massive CPU and RAM at the VMs to create them and update, once completed I would remove the additional resources and then “sweat” the VMs. 4. Hyper-V Replica. This is a great tool for us and almost feels like it was custom written for us. I guess pretty much everyone is thinking that. However, there is a slight spanner in the works for us. By this I mean a little bit of a re-think in terms of how we present storage especially to the VMs which we want to have as part of our “DR Cloud” if you will. We present a lot of our additional drives directly via iSCSI, This is great and iSCSI works well, VERY well. However when you are trying to think about a DR situation, it adds complexity as you can replicate the VM only, you then need to replicate the presented iSCSI volumes and then reconfigure the network cards. Hence the “re-think” we are looking at a better way to work around this. We want and need Hyper-V replica.ODX Offload. This is one I am waiting to test, our SAN Vendor has promised this in the next release of their firmware. More to come on this as soon as I can give some more information on this.More to come I promise,Follow me. \n","permalink":"https://flkellyneucloudblogpre.z16.web.core.windows.net/2012/09/06/my-windows-server-2012-journey/","tags":["2012","hyper-v","Hyper-V3","Replica","VHDX","Windows Server 2012"],"title":"My Windows Server 2012 Journey"},{"categories":["Failover Clustering","Hyper-V"],"contents":"Just recently I was running into some very strange issues with my Hyper-V Cluster. we have numerous NICs to allow for redundancy and better throughput for our clustered environment. We have a total of 11 NICs on our server to cater for Guest LAN, iSCSI, guest iSCSI (as we present SAN storage directly to the Guests), HeartBeat and Live Migration. So, I was getting a little concerned when I was performing maintenance and/or “Live Migrations” and my VMs were losing network connectivity both on LAN connections and iSCSI connections which was causing major issues with my VMs needing external storage as this was mostly SQL or file shares. So time to start troubleshooting.First stop would obviously be the NICs on the hosts and I spent some time checking all the NICs and ensuring they are cabled correctly. Not the world’s easiest job considering the amount of network cables we have in our cabinets. We have numerous Hyper-V nodes, all with 11 NICs excluding Management and iDRAC. So we are talking hundreds of cables. However, I trudged through it and put a check mark next to it – no issues there.So, several hours and days later and cursing and swearing all the network cables, velcro and cable ties in my cabinets, it was time to move on. So, it was NOT a physical network issue. Time to give a little further. My next stop was the Hypervisor layer.I start diving through the Hypervisor and I found “gold” here, (I actually mean the cause of my issue). Enter Hyper-V Networking. Please allow me to clarify this. The networking was not the issue but what someone/something had done, the truth here will never be known. I found that I had duplicate Virtual Network created. So, for each physical NIC i had in the server and was using for the Virtualization, I had 2 networks. 1 connected to the “External Network” and here is the kicker, 1 connected to the “PRIVATE” network. So with a little troubleshooting and deal of understanding Virtual Switches, I was able to return my cluster to it’s former 100% redundant glory. After removing ALL the private networks and there were many on all my Nodes, I was able to Live Migrate and patch/maintain to my heart’s content.Gotta love Virtualization.Hopefully this will help someone else as well.The lesson here is to keep a good eye on your Virtual Environment and always check the basics.Follow me. \n","permalink":"https://flkellyneucloudblogpre.z16.web.core.windows.net/2012/08/28/networking-issues-with-hyper-v/","tags":["Failover Cluster","hyper-v","NIC","nics","Virtual Switches"],"title":"Networking issues with Hyper-V"},{"categories":["Uncategorized"],"contents":"","permalink":"https://flkellyneucloudblogpre.z16.web.core.windows.net/2012/08/13/dpm-and-exchange-mail-store-backup-failing/","tags":["backup","DPM","Exchange","Failing"],"title":"DPM and Exchange Mail Store Backup failing"},{"categories":["System Center"],"contents":"So, in an effort to get my business ready for Service Requests as we use mainly Incidents and we are beginning our journey into Service Requests and differentiating between Service Requests (day to day operations) and Incidents (something is broken), I needed to reproduce a workflow to notify the “AssignedToUser” when a new Service Request is assigned to him or her. I already had a downloaded Management Pack for Incident Re-assignment notifications which was modified for my purposes, so this was a good place to start. I found these management packs as a nice start as well. I have since modified these to create a Service Request Re-Assignment Management Pack, as with all my searching, I could not find ANYTHING!!!!

So, another challenge, no worries. I took all the data from the SQL query and pasted it into Excel. So now, I have noticed that tracking down a GUID for a Template in a Custom MP is not the easiest. I ended up looking at the “Property Field” and was able to determine the Template I needed from the information in the “property field” due to the “Subject” line in my e-mail template.

In general, Service Manager was SLOW!!!! After much troubleshooting and some help from MS. It was determined to be a corrupt workflow, what had actually happened to me, is that my MP containing my Workflow was corrupted. So, I stopped the “Health Service”, disabled all the workflows and slowly started re-enabling workflows and then starting the “Health Service” again and slowly started testing like that and I was able to determine that any workflow or template within a set MP was causing the SQL Blocking.

It appears easy enough if you follow the Technet articles. This addresses the need for Service Accounts and the permissions needed by these accounts and there functions. It also helps you to size and decide the Orchestrator installation type that would best suit your environment. It helps you to decide the best way to break the components if you want to.However, the one thing that I found to be lacking was the actual components needed by SCORCH, like the Features and Roles. I followed the default Technet articles and setup the required accounts and then proceeded with the installation of SCORCH, one of the easiest installs. However, one component would not install, the Orchestrator Console and this was somewhat annoying and would not do. I did some searching around and found quite a handy PowerShell script which was used by someone else who ran into a similar issue. This script enables a few components and once this was done, the SCORCH installation completed without issue.

We were seeing an error event ID: 1304 as below.\nSo, we began to investigate as all the Technet articles state that the drive is corrupted and Disk Signatures need to be changed, however we have had no major changes in the last little while. We were also able to view to CSV Volume from our SAN management tools. So, we were confused. The disk just would not come online.1 . The Quorum was online, or else the cluster would not come online.2. All the nodes were online.3. All Networks were online4. The cluster virtual name and IP was up.However, only CSV would not come online. So, we began to dig a little bit deeper and discovered that the error message was a little misleading, it did however contain some useful information. From the error message we were able to glean the problem node (CSV Owner). We then hopped onto the problem node and after a little digging around, discovered that the volume had been set to OFFLINE. We set the volume to ONLINE and then tried to bring the resource ONLINE in Failover Cluster Manager and hey PRESTO!!! The volume can online and so did my VMs.I have since created a PowerShell script which can be found hereto help the troubleshooting process. All you need to do is provide the list of cluster/s to be checked. It does the following.1. Check if the nodes state is in an “UP” state. If the node is in an up state, it then checks the status of the Cluster Service and reports if it is up or down.2. It then checks the CSV state and specifies the current owner of the CSV and then lets you know if the CSV online or reserved. This is good.3. Should it get a state other than this, it then proceeds to run a list disk from diskpart on the reported CSV owners to help you find which CSV and which owner to start working on.Follow me.\n","permalink":"https://flkellyneucloudblogpre.z16.web.core.windows.net/2012/06/07/basic-cluster-troubleshooting/","tags":["Cluster Service","CSV","node","owner","powershell","Troubleshooting"],"title":"Basic Cluster Troubleshooting"},{"categories":["Operations Manager"],"contents":"So, recently I decided to take the plunge and upgrade to SCOM 2012. So, there were a few pre-requisites that I needed as per the prereq checker that is built into OpsMan 2012.The “big ones” were as follows. 1. OpsMan 2007 R2 CU52. And FTS (Full Text Search) for SQL. So, these seem easy enough to fix. 1. Simple downloadCumulative Update 5 for System Center Operations Manager 2007 R2and install. To be honest, I found this articlesuper helpful for the installation of this Cumulative Update, nice and easy to follow. Kudos toKevin Holman. So after running through the process step by step, I found that the build number had NOT increased to 6.1.7221.81. Very strange indeed. This needed some more investigation, but more on that just now.2. Simple go and add this feature to your SQL instance, not very difficult to, so I simply walk through the wizard and add the feature. So, now time to run the Pre-Req checker again, and what do you know the Cumulative Update 5 is NO LONGER showing (but remember the build version in the console is NOT reflecting the correct build number. Also, the FTS (Full Text Search) requirement is still there and I am have installed the FTS feature.\nHowever as you can see below.\nVery strange indeed, so like I said some further investigation is required.I remember being at some Microsoft IT Bootcamps, and the continued emphasis on SQL Collation and OpsMan in general.

I have found that the following can cause some complications and how to “mitigate” these if you will.\nService Manager 2010\nConnectors – Please make sure that your connectors are NOT running while you do the upgrade, the upgrade will work, however your connectors will run and attempt to catch up with itself.

Cubes – If you are upgrading from a PRE-RTM Version to RTM, please note that I am sure that is not supported by Microsoft unless you were a TAP customer. So, this would be more for a lab environment. If your cubes are running, please allow them to process and ensure that they are in a processed and preferably NOT a “Partial Processed” state. Please also check the status of these job as per the TECHNET article and ensure that get-scdwjob returns all jobs in a “Not Started” state.\n Fix : Ensure all cubes are in a processed state and NOT “Running” or “Partial Processed” As for System Centre Service Manager 2012, the connectors are greatly improved in SCSM 2012, while your SCSM 2010 Connectors will work, you will see that there is a difference in the Connectors as seen below.\n\nThe old connectors “Active Directory” are migrated from SCSM 2010 to SCSM 2012. However, the new type “ADConnector” are more robust and more streamlined. I would recommend Creating the new type for all your existing connectors, disabling the existing and running only the new connectors.

I decided NOT to use SSL from the get go, as there APPEARS to be a “niggly” with Certificates, it would appear that since I have implemented my portal, a TechNet article has been released to address this issue. I Chose to use port 5555 for the SharePoint Service (SCSMWebContentServer). You will need to UNCHECK “Use SSL”, go back and then go forward again, not sure if just works like that. When you get to the option to configure the portal, I chose to use port 5556 (Service Manager Portal), again NO SSL Select the required database, your Service Manager database on your Primary Service Manager Management Server. Once completed, you have a nice starting for portal based on SharePoint Foundation.   \n Okay, so now some funnies and nigglies I have picked up, please note that this is beta software and this might account for some of these.\n When you open the portal for the first time, you will be greeted by a team site http://:  Easily solved, the actual portal hides under /smportal, so it you go to :/smportal\u0026quot;\u0026gt;:/smportal\u0026quot;\u0026gt;:/smportal\u0026quot;\u0026gt;http://:/smportal, you will see your familiar portal as above.  You will need to add all domain users to the read group, this can be modified under “Sit Actions” –\u0026gt; “Site Permissions”, then create a group and add “\\domain users and give them “Read” permissions. As an extension of this, I had to add my end users to some roles in Service Manager itself. I created an Active Directory group and add all my end users to this group. Then I went into Service Manager and the “Administration” Pane –\u0026gt; Security –\u0026gt; User Roles –\u0026gt; add created group to “Read-Only Operators” With the Self-Service Portal and Service and Request Offerings, it would appear that the Icons (for me at least) are limited to .JPG showing in the portal.

So to work around theses issues, I did the following.\nCreate a custom report from SQL Reporting Services and modified for my needs, I was focusing more on “Incident Analyst” and I was looking for a breakdown of the number of Incidents per Analysts in a week period. This becomes tricky as the Analyst wanted this to be automated for reporting purposes.\n  If you using SQL 2008 R2, Report Builder 3 will be available to you from the SSRS webpage.\n  Select File, Open, drill down to System Center\\ServiceManager\\ServiceManager.Console.Reporting.IncidentManagement and select\n   ServiceManager.Report.IncidentManagement.IncidentAnalystReport\nThis time it opens OK – let’s try and do a “Save As”, just to see what we can do with a report.\nThe first error is complaining about a mismatch between allowed values and the default for the TimeZone parameter:\n\nTo “correct this” go to Parameters, TimeZone – double-click it.\nSelect the Default Values and change the option to No default Value:\n\nClick OK and select Save As (Don’t forget to change the report name again as it would appear that when a failed save occurs then the original name is used – and thus you may make a change to the default report).\nThe next error again concerns a defaultvalue for the EndDate_OffsetValue parameter this time.\n\nAgain change the Default Value of this parameter to No Default Value\n\nAgain attempt the Save As (again check the name). This time it should succeed.\nSo now we effectively have a report that we can manipulate to utilise a variable parameter for the StartDate and EndDate values.\nDouble-click the StartDate_BaseValue parameter. Click the Default Values option and select “Specify values”\nClick Add and strike the (Null) that appears in the Value form.\nClick the function button\nIn the Category chooser, select “Common Functions” “Date \u0026amp; Time”\nLocate the “Today” item and double-click it.\nClose the bracket in the “Set expression for Value option:\n\nClick OK.\nRepeat this step for the EndDate_BaseValue Parameter.\nNow make the change to the StartDate_OffsetType to switch the interval from the past month to the past week.\nDouble-click StartDate_OffsetType, select Default Values and change the Value option from Month to Week.\n\nSo back to Report Manager – drill down to the new report and open it up. Run the report using the View Report button – no results returned.\nCheck the NULL option for Incident IDs\n\nAnd now re-run – data as expected. The Challenge now is to select the NULL option for a scheduled report as opposed to the interactive one.\nClick “New Subscription”\nPopulate the Report Delivery Options and Subscription Processing Options as required – I used a File Share (NB it needs a UNC \\server\\share) and just set up a schedule in 5 mins time to use an HTML 4 report. (NB You will need to repeat the password for the account that will write the report after you have clicked the schedule button as it loses the password and saving the subscription will fail)\nThen in the Report Parameter Values ensure the following two options are selected. NB Do not set these in the Properties, Parameters option of Report Manager as they have a different impact.\n\n\nSave the changes and wait for the report to run – this should now pick up the correct “current” date and provide a week’s worth of data!\n  Now, you try to run the report and under “Assigned To User”, you try to use UPN names or Display Names and nothing seems to work! This is because the Report is actually looking for a UserDimkey, this can be seen in this post. So how do you get this information. SQL is your friend.\n  Open SQL Management Studio on the Data Warehouse Server and run the following command substituting the User Display name you want to find the UserDimKey for.\n   /**\\* Script for SelectTopNRows command from SSMS ***/\nSELECT TOP 1000 [AssetStatus]\n,[AssetStatus_ConfigItemAssetStatusId]\n,[BaseManagedEntityId]\n,[BusinessPhone]\n,[BusinessPhone2]\n,[City]\n,[Company]\n,[Country]\n,[Department]\n,[DisplayName]\n,[DistinguishedName]\n,[Domain]\n,[EmployeeId]\n,[EntityDimKey]\n,[Fax]\n,[FirstName]\n,[FQDN]\n,[HomePhone]\n,[HomePhone2]\n,[Initials]\n,[InsertedBatchId]\n,[IsDeleted]\n,[LastName]\n,[Mobile]\n,[Notes]\n,[ObjectStatus]\n,[ObjectStatus_ConfigItemObjectStatusId]\n,[Office]\n,[Pager]\n,[SID]\n,[SourceId]\n,[State]\n,[StreetAddress]\n,[Title]\n,[UpdatedBatchId]\n,[UPN]\n,[UserDimKey]\n,[UserName]\n,[Zip]\nFROM [DWDataMartR2].[dbo].[UserDimvw] where [DisplayName] = ‘DisplayNameofUserInActiveDirectory 5.

A few glitches, Point #2, a picture as in the background with control boxes over it. Um……\nSo, I managed to work around that with playing with the image size and using it as a “Watermark”. One sneaky little thing done, a few more to go. Then I went about adding all my controls for specific entries.\nSo, now onto the save to SharePoint with unique names. Enter a little bit of VBA coding and lots of Uncle Google. I was able to create a mapped drive in VBA, as you cannot save directly to SharePoint. So, map a drive to the folder that can exposed via SharePoint, when you select “Explorer View”. I was then able to use VBA to read information from a TextBox to create the file name.

There is nothing worse than getting a phone call saying that critical services are unavailable at a CRITICAL time. What a nightmare. So a few plans were set in motion.\nFINALLY, I got my request for DFS approved. YAY!!!!\nSo, the process started. Installing DFS for Windows Server 2008 R2 is really simple and was completed in a couple of minutes, however the fun starts after the install and with the configuration of the replicated folders. The above link covers all aspects of the install and “sub” installs and procedures like configuring a namespace and replicated folders.\nThere is just one little “gotcha” I came across, when I tried to create the first replicated folder, I configured the replication pair with the “root” folder. When I was running through the wizard I got an error when trying to replicate security permissions. The mistake I was making was to include the “root” folder. Do NOT do this. The solution is simple, create the root DFS namespace and create separate replicated folder pairs for each sub folder and then wait for the replication to occur. Awesome!!!!!!\n So now, for additional redundancy. we have another 3rd party application which handles printing and we need to keep an empty “folder structure” for this somewhere safe in case of a DR situation. This is a requirement placed on us by the Vendor. So, I like powershell, so I decided to create a powershell script to do this for me and, of course, the reverse of creating the “folder structure”. Scripts are below.\n  Create-FolderStructure.ps1#Create an array with folder objects\n$dirs = get-childitem -Recurse | Where {$_.psIsContainer -eq $true}\n#get folder full names\n$dirs | select fullname | out-file\n  So, now you have the folder structure, Great!!!!\nHowever now you need to re-create the folder structure.

For me, the next step is to open Outlook and connect to Exchange via OutlookAnywhere, also worked, so far so good. So I make my way into the office and i decide to check Exchange further.

I discovered this by removing some unnecessary files on the server and I performed a get-queue and I had a few more queues. Great, Progress!!!!\nSo now, after running through a few additional steps. (Tested on Exchange 2010)  Pause the Microsoft Exchange Transport Service (this allows the queue to be processed cleanly (without adding any additional messages)\n  Copy mail queue data folder (default “c:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\Exchange Server\\V14\\TransportRoles\\data\\Queue) to a safe place( rather safe than sorry)\n  Navigate to Exchange Queue Folder (c:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\Exchange Server\\V14\\TransportRoles\\data\\Queue)\n  Use eseutil to determine shutdown state. eseutil /mh mail.que  If the state is “Dirty Shutdown”. eseutil /p mail.queto repair the file (if “Clean Shutdown” move to next step)  Run eseutil /d mail.que  Restart Microsoft Exchange Transport Service\n  So now, you should be back up and running and mailflow has been restored, but now how the heck do you prevent this from happening again?\nEnter “EdgeTransport.exe.config” (“c:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\Exchange Server\\V14\\Bin”)\nThe entries listed below can de modified to move the folder that holds mail.que onto a separate drive with more space.\nSimply modify the values to meet the folder requirements on the new drive.\nFollow me\n \n","permalink":"https://flkellyneucloudblogpre.z16.web.core.windows.net/2011/06/07/exchangeing-e-mail/","tags":["eseutil","HUB Transport","Mail","Mailflow","Queue"],"title":"Exchange(ing) e-mail"},{"categories":["Technology"],"contents":"Have you ever been in a situation where you have either removed or added a new DPM server to your environment?\nIt happened to me just the other day, I had to “re-think” my DPM design and starting using “Local” to each Data Centre DPM servers to backup my data at each Data Centre.

If i can do it, so can anyone.\n\nThe Article here, is exactly what I used, hope you find it as rewarding as I did.\n Thanks Travis.\n“EMBRACE YOUR INNER GEEK AND\nROCK ON”\n","permalink":"https://flkellyneucloudblogpre.z16.web.core.windows.net/2011/03/29/service-manager-2010-sp1-custom-portal/","tags":null,"title":"Service Manager 2010 SP1 Custom Portal"},{"categories":["Uncategorized"],"contents":"Just recently, as in the weekend just gone, I had a change for an upgrade of SQL 2008 to SQL 2008 R2. The one half went like a dream.\nHowever the other half, revoking names on purpose, was not so easy. Let’s just say that Reporting Services is not always the easiest thing to upgrade. My upgrade went TERRIBLY wrong. It was however a great learning exercise and at the same time reminds we why i LOVE DPM so much, SQL backups through DPM are the king. Again, i will scream this “ I LOVE DPM!!!!”\nIn this process of the upgrade I ended up with some “Suspect” databases. I found some scripts that MIGHT allow the recovery of the data. PLEASE NOTE THAT IS A LAST DITCH EFFORT. The scripts below should only be used as a final resort as there MIGHT be DATA LOSS.\n They should be used in the following order\n  SETEmeregency.sql (put database in emergency mode and attempt repair, PLEASE NOTE AGAIN THAT THERE MIGHT BE DATA LOSS\n  FindSPID.sql (find which SPID is locking the database)\n  KillSPID (kill the connection that is locking the database.\n  SQL SetMultiUser (put database in multi-user mode and check, and hope that there is no data loss.\n  In case the files do not upload correctly.\nSETEmergency.sql\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;!--CRLF--\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;pre style=\u0026quot;text-align:left;line-height:12pt;background-color:#f4f4f4;width:100%;font-family:\u0026amp;#039;direction:ltr;color:black;font-size:8pt;overflow:visible;border-style:none;margin:0;padding:0;\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color:#606060;\u0026quot;

I am not sure what i did to piss off Murphy, but as usual with me and BitLocker something went wrong. I could no longer boot into Windows. No worries, I have my recovery key, so I go home and connect my Hard Drive to an enclosure, and try to access the data. As expected I get asked for the Recovery Key, which was saved on a flash drive. I duly enter the Recovery and verify it to discover that Windows will NOT accept it. I try to run a repair to correct the BootLoader problem, NO JOY!!!!!!, WITH NO BACKUP AT ALL.\nSo there is nothing to be done, FORMAT, OUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and start again.

Yes, the bike is fixed and I am dying (no one is to take that literally please) to get back onto the bike. Tomorrow, I am in the car, to replace the windscreen. Like I said, having some funky luck as of late. The finished product compliments of DIY and not getting HUGE labour costs.
