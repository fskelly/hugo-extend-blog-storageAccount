    Man alive, i never actually thought that I would be such an advocate for all the process, policies and procedures at my previous company. It is truly amazing what an awareness course and ITIL V3 Foundations course can do for a person’s perspective. After going through the training and understanding the methodology, it makes a lot more sense. However, do not get me wrong, I still believe that ITIL is based on UTOPIA and free and void of REAL WORLD business constraints. A lot of the information learned in ITIL can be implemented and the practices should serve as a FRAMEWORK.

    So, on that note, enter System Centre Service Manager. What a phenomenal tool. There is a LOT of config and even more reading to do, we are however making some good progress and automating a LOT of our IT responses, if you are willing to invest the time and effort. I am VERY certain that this tool WILL change your company’s perception of IT.
