Hi all,

i have been playing with SMLets3 and get-scsmobject and using information from the post by Travis Wright, [Using SMLets Beta 3 Post #1 – Using Get-SCSMObject, Get-SCSMClass to Dump Data from SCSM][1]. This is an amazing post and I have been able to create a script that queries all Cases created after a certain date. It then gives you the breakdown of Open, Closed, Resolved and other status cases, which is then e-mailed to you. I will continue to play with this and post more as I am able to create more scripts. My first script can be found here, [SCSMCallBreakDownWithEMail][2]. As I update the scripts and create more, I will let everyone know.

I am also starting to focus on Active Directory again, and I am working on some handy scripts.

Until Then,
