    You know the saying, ‚ÄúTechnology is a mixed blessing‚Äù.¬† I think that whoever said this, had this aimed at me the last few days. We have had some crazy stuff happen. Take the following equation.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    (lots of exchange servers) + Blade Enclosures (very far behind on firmware) + Too many ideas + Outsource partner +Too few resources to implement the changes and what do you get?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Answer : Lots of late nights and Vendors on-site for numerous days and very little progress.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I will not mention names of resources or companies, but for those of you who know me, you who the Outsource Partner and the Vendor.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We, however, to spite everything seem to have made some progress. So far so good, we still have teething problems at the moment.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    How is this for an odd issue, anyone with Delegated rights, given or received are having calendar items disappear but ONLY with Cached Mode on. Quite odd, but nice and challenging, there is an answer out there somewhere.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    PS, if anyone knows where that somewhere is, please enlighten me.
