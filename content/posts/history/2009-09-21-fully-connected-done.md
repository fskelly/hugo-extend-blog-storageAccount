    So, with the weekend just passed. I got fully connected and got to try something new üôÇ (always a plus for me).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I got to play (and get working) WDS (Wireless Distribution System). This is also got another hiccup sorted for me.¬† This hiccup quite simple out was that my XBOX 360 does NOT have the Wireless Connector, so as per a previous blog entry. ICS was my friend with my XBOX 360 connected directly to my laptop.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    ENTER THIS WEEKEND.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Now, I finally got my B970, welcome to a fully connected network.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I have a wireless router with my PS3 and XBOX 360 connected to it. So no need for the wireless connector on the XBOX 360.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I also have a 8 port switch in my computer room, with 2 machines and my printer and the B970 connected to this.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    On both routers I have ‚ÄúWireless Bridge‚Äù mode enabled and both routers broadcasting the same SSID and on the same channel. So what I hear you ask.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    ‚ÄúSO WHAT?‚Äù
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This give me full connectivity with 2 separate wireless routers with 1 connected to a switch. So bottom line, I can have all my consoles and machines and server connected to the internet at the same time in simple controlled manner.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I am EXTREMELY chuffed. üôÇ
