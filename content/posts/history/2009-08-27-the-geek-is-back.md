    Hi Everyone,
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Yes, it is true, the geek is back.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    He had found a dark deep hole in the back of my mind and thoroughly entrenched.¬† With a lot of coaxing and bribery, I have lured him out and what a comeback üôÇ
  </p>
  
  <p>

  <p>
    Recent additions ( 3/4 months)
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      2 Servers ‚Äì 1 Running WHS (Windows Home Server) to handle my streaming needs and storage needs. Of course. 1 Running Windows Server 2008 R2 (as a domain controller of course. What do you mean you do not have a DC in your house). This same machine will be running my VM‚Äôs, with the perks of R2.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Playstation 3 ‚Äì Blu-Ray player and gaming console to boot.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      So now I have my WHS Server storing content and streaming to my PS3 and my XBOX 360 will be joining the fun soon, finding the wireless adapter for XBOX 360 is not easy. But with time and patience everything is possible.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Now the last two things for ‚ÄúULTIMATE GEEKINESS‚Äù.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      1. PSP being used with Remote Play to stream content to my PSP when I am not in front of my TV.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      2. GUITAR HERO, I mean which setup is not complete without Guitar Hero.
