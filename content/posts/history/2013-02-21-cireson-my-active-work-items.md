So, [Cireson](http://www.cireson.com/) has been hard at work to fill a few gaps present within the Service Manager space. [Cireson](http://www.cireson.com/) has created an application called [My Active Work Items](http://www.cireson.com/app-store/scsm-my-work-items/) to bring all information assigned to your user token in one place. For Service Manager 2010, you could create the ~~Work Items assigned to Me~~ view. This was a good start for SCSM 2010 and this continues to work with SCSM 2012. However, with SCSM 2012, there are a few shortcomings of this view. The ~~Work Items assigned to Me~~, it only shows some very limited information and this view cannot be edited.

Please make no error, this view is helpful and can provide the required information. It is still context driven on the right hand pane.

But now, enter [My Active Work Items](http://www.cireson.com/app-store/scsm-my-work-items/). Below is a screenshot to give you an idea of how it looks. I will then look at individual aspects.

If you have multiple work items of the Same type, For example, Incidents, they will be grouped together. In the Screenshot below, I have created 2 incidents to demonstrate this.

the pane below the “My Active Work Items” provides all information needed about the highlighted work item at a glance.

All the other features associated to the Highlighted work item are available as a right click context item. I will show a few examples below.

Also note the "[My Active Work Items](http://www.cireson.com/app-store/scsm-my-work-items/)" context menu which allows easy to the creation of any type of Work Item.

The installation and configuration of [My Active Work Items](http://www.cireson.com/app-store/scsm-my-work-items/) is very simple and quick. The installation instructions provided are clear and concise and the settings, found under Administration –> Settings can be easily tweaked and changed to suit your needs.

If you have looked at my previous [Cireson Group Assign][13] post, you will see that the AD Groups leveraged within that Service Manager application can be leveraged again.

All in all, [Cireson](http://www.cireson.com/) have a great application with [My Active Work Items](http://www.cireson.com/app-store/scsm-my-work-items/) and I would highly recommend it for any Service Manager 2012 installation. It also work with Service Manager 2012 Service Pack 1.
