    A friend introduced me to <a href="http://www.smugmug.com">SmugMug</a> and what a pleasure. There is a fee involved. I went for the $39.95 Standard Option. So far so good, it an awesome, very customizable and the <a href="http://www.smugmug.com">SmugMug</a> Power and Pro Options are even more phenomenal. I am uploading all my photos and you can allow people to view, and with the use of password, prevent them from downloading your precious photos.

    <a href="http://www.smugmug.com">SmugMug</a> Rocks, if you join with some other apps like Adobe Lightroom or ACDsee, there are built-in features for uploading straight to <a href="http://www.smugmug.com">SmugMug</a>.
