It has been a little bit of a busy while for me. However, I finally found the time to complete the Custom Service Manager Portal, I have not as yet implemented custom graphics. The end result is great, it has a far cleaner look and like the post says, feels a lot more like SharePoint. Finally you can see a shot of it, NOT in a document<img style="border-style:none;" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" alt="Smile" src="http://fskelly.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/wlemoticon-smile.png" /> . If i can do it, so can anyone.

The [Article][2] here, is exactly what I used, hope you find it as rewarding as I did.

Thanks Travis.
