    Been gone a little while. However a lot has happened in that time. Gone through 2 jobs, or at least left one and then decided the most recent was NO GOOD for me at all. For now, i will not mention names. So it is out with the old and in with the NEW.

    Let the new challenges begin. ðŸ™‚ On a bit of a side-note, I am back on the bikes with compliments of a learnerâ€™s licence. hopefully this time I will get off my ass in time and it will not lapse. Things are already in motion to get the full licence.
