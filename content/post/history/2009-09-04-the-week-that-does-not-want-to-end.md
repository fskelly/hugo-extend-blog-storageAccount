    So, the last few days have been interesting and LONG. Sleep has been and still is a valuable commodity.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The night before last was visiting night, so of course, the first causality there is SLEEP. I only managed to squeeze in a few hours, as in 3.

    Then, last night our Exchange Environment decided to break properly.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Basically to cut a long story short, still need more sleep.
