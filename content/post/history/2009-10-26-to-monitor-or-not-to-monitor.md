    It has been a little while since I have last posted. Have been a little busy with personal issues, I do not log EVERYTHING :P.
  </p>

    Anyways, onto the technology part :). I have just been on some training and playing with X-Plat with Operations Manager 2007 R2. If you want an integrated monitoring solution, Operation Manager 2007 R2 is the answer. A new buzz word doing the rounds (yes, I am guilty as well) is “X-Plat”. So what exactly is X-Plat? It is a way of monitoring certain Unix/Linux platforms. There is a little bit (actually a lot) of work that goes into setting it up in the first place and there is use of certificates involved with the communication as well. It may sound very daunting. Stick with it and you will be rewarded, the reporting and monitoring is great.

    Just some tips.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    1. Ensure you know Linux fairly well, or have access to someone who knows Linux quite well.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    2. Watch out for routing tables when playing in a virtual environment.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    3. Telnet is your friend when testing ports
  </p>
  
  <p>
    4. Netstat works in Linux as well.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    5. You need port 1270 open on the Unix/Linux environment, if you do not have this open, you are wasting your time.
