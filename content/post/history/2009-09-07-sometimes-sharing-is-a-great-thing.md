    As I am quite sure most of you know, Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 share the same kernel. As part of a previous entry, we know that this opens a up a whole new area to play in. The previous post I mentioned shows me running WSS on Windows 7. This post takes this one step further and really shows what, with a little creativity (not mine admittedly), you can do.

    Imagine being able to run Windows Server 2008 R2 and making it look like Windows 7. Yes, it can be done, I have done it, and it works, no one is the wiser. I find it quite amusing. It also SEEMS that Windows Server 2008 R2 is a little quicker, I know that is hard to believe as Windows 7 is a serious step up from Vista, Windows Server 2008 R2 is a step up from Windows 7. Hard to believe, but it is. üôÇ

    While we are talking about some interesting things, DELL has woken up and finally released Windows 7 drivers (x86 and x64), thank you DELL :). My model is the DELL Precision M4400. If you have a DELL, check out the site, maybe you get a pleasant surprise.

    As with Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2 has no issues with any of the drivers and /or devices on my machine. So far so good. I have been running it now like this for a few days. If I find any show stoppers, you will be sure to find here.
